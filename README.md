# DeviantBot
Facebook Bot using SDK v5 for PHP

## How it works

This bot uses DeviantArt Media RSS to get the raw data, then uses 
Embed DeviantArt media to get more detailed information about each image. 

Image proccesing is pretty much done at random, unless the image contains
adult content.

### Built With

* [Facebook SDK for PHP (v5)](https://github.com/facebook/php-graph-sdk) - Used to access the Facebook Platform from the app
* [Intervention Image](http://image.intervention.io/) - The image handling and manipulation library
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) - Dependency Management
