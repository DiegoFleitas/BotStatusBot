We have free healthcare, but the National Health Service is currently being dismantled by the incumbent Tory government at an alarming rate, in order to try and privatise it into the American health insurance-based system (which &lt;i&gt;nobody&lt;/i&gt; with a brain wants). Education standards keep falling, partially because successive governments keep introducing more tests on schoolkids; partially because British kids start school way too young (I had to start school at &lt;i&gt;four-years old&lt;/i&gt;, when I couldn&#039;t even talk properly no thanks to delayed speech issues); and partially because the school system is an outdated, authoritarian relic of the Victorian era. House prices are too expensive for most ordinary people now, especially in London; everyone outside of big cities (and even within cities now) seems to be a xenophobe; British politics right now is an admittedly entertaining trainwreck; the mainstream media is corrupt and biased towards the Tory Party; and political opposition outside of Westminster seems to be nonexistent (or more sinisterly, curbed... Apart from the current Labour Party and smaller parties that have nothing to lose right now.

We have free healthcare, but the National Health Service is currently being dismantled by the incumbent Tory government at an alarming rate, in order to try and privatise it into the American health insurance-based system (which &lt;i&gt;nobody&lt;/i&gt; with a brain wants). Education standards keep falling, partially because successive governments keep introducing more tests on schoolkids; partially because British kids start school way too young (I had to start school at &lt;i&gt;four-years old&lt;/i&gt;, when I couldn&#039;t even talk properly no thanks to delayed speech issues); and partially because the school system is an outdated, authoritarian relic of the Victorian era. House prices are too expensive for most ordinary people now, especially in London; everyone outside of big cities (and even within cities now) seems to be a xenophobe; British politics right now is an admittedly entertaining trainwreck; the mainstream media is corrupt and biased towards the Tory Party; and political opposition outside of Westminster seems to be nonexistent (or more sinisterly, curbed... Apart from the current Labour Party and smaller parties that have nothing to lose right now. There also hasn&#039;t been any significant protests or riots since the 2011 summer riots, aside from public sector strikes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point is, Britain isn&#039;t a great place to be living in right now, especially since the political situation is deteriorating by the day, what with Brexit looming over current politics.

Most mainstream socialists are social democrats who want to &quot;humanise&quot; capitalism, not destroy it completely. Some hardline socialists and communists essentially call social democrats &quot;posers&quot;, however, because they don&#039;t want to replace capitalism with a more &quot;egalitarian&quot; (read: communist) system. (Even then, you have anarchist socialists who don&#039;t believe in the basic concept of the state, so they tend to oppose state socialists and communists anyway. The same hardliners also now dislike people like Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn for not being left-wing enough. Go figure. &lt;img src=&quot;https://e.deviantart.net/emoticons/l/lol.gif&quot; width=&quot;15&quot; height=&quot;15&quot; alt=&quot;:lol:&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;emoticon&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;384&quot; title=&quot;LOL&quot;/&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#039;m not really anti-capitalist even though I have a lot of issues with it as an economic system because I&#039;m aware that it&#039;s the most successful system in the world. I personally have a problem with laissez-faire, extremely free &quot;neoliberal&quot; capitalism, because that&#039;s the system my country&#039;s been stuck in for nearly 40 years now and all it&#039;s done is made people suffer - for one, my generation is predicted to be the first to be &lt;i&gt;worse off&lt;/i&gt; than their parents. It also doesn&#039;t help that neoliberal capitalism has created a strong elite in Britain that refuses to pay taxes fairly (meaning that both ordinary people and public services suffer from poverty and poor performance), and because they control the media, they keep slagging off the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn at every waking moment because they&#039;re the strongest opposition against this bullshit, and the most likely party to get into government come next election. I&#039;d personally much rather have a &quot;mixed economy&quot; or Keynesian system where there is some state and private control over different services. ...Actually, this &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; the system Britain used to have, until Margaret Thatcher came along and it killed it off. &lt;img src=&quot;https://e.deviantart.net/emoticons/r/rolleyes.gif&quot; width=&quot;15&quot; height=&quot;15&quot; alt=&quot;:roll:&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;emoticon&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;393&quot; title=&quot;Roll Eyes&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point is, I&#039;m aware that capitalism has pros and cons. It&#039;s the most successful economic system because it&#039;s not excessive about the control of production, nor does it encourage protectionism and high tariffs. It&#039;s also one of the most destructive systems if not intervened with by the state, because thousands of people can be left in poverty if not supported by say, a welfare system. (Which is what is happening in Britain now sadly, yet the current Tory government doesn&#039;t give a shit.) Neither neoliberal capitalism or a command (communist) economy are ideal, and in my opinion the best system is a Keynesian economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_self&quot; href=&quot;https://maturity1plz.deviantart.com/&quot; &gt;&lt;img class=&quot;avatar&quot; width=&quot;50&quot; height=&quot;50&quot; src=&quot;https://a.deviantart.net/avatars/m/a/maturity1plz.gif?1&quot; alt=&quot;:iconmaturity1plz:&quot; title=&quot;maturity1plz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_self&quot; href=&quot;https://maturity2plz.deviantart.com/&quot; &gt;&lt;img class=&quot;avatar&quot; width=&quot;50&quot; height=&quot;50&quot; src=&quot;https://a.deviantart.net/avatars/m/a/maturity2plz.gif?1&quot; alt=&quot;:iconmaturity2plz:&quot; title=&quot;maturity2plz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</media:description>            <media:thumbnail url="https://orig00.deviantart.net/4b18/f/2017/363/a/6/capitalism_by_mintaka_tk-dby8ahc.png" height="56" width="99"/>            <media:thumbnail url="https://orig00.deviantart.net/4b18/f/2017/363/a/6/capitalism_by_mintaka_tk-dby8ahc.png" height="56" width="99"/>            <media:thumbnail url="https://orig00.deviantart.net/4b18/f/2017/363/a/6/capitalism_by_mintaka_tk-dby8ahc.png" height="56" width="99"/>            <media:content url="https://orig00.deviantart.net/4b18/f/2017/363/a/6/capitalism_by_mintaka_tk-dby8ahc.png" height="56" width="99" medium="image"/>

Most mainstream socialists are social democrats who want to &quot;humanise&quot; capitalism, not destroy it completely. Some hardline socialists and communists essentially call social democrats &quot;posers&quot;, however, because they don&#039;t want to replace capitalism with a more &quot;egalitarian&quot; (read: communist) system. (Even then, you have anarchist socialists who don&#039;t believe in the basic concept of the state, so they tend to oppose state socialists and communists anyway. The same hardliners also now dislike people like Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn for not being left-wing enough. Go figure. &lt;img src=&quot;https://e.deviantart.net/emoticons/l/lol.gif&quot; width=&quot;15&quot; height=&quot;15&quot; alt=&quot;:lol:&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;emoticon&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;384&quot; title=&quot;LOL&quot;/&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#039;m not really anti-capitalist even though I have a lot of issues with it as an economic system because I&#039;m aware that it&#039;s the most successful system in the world. I personally have a problem with laissez-faire, extremely free &quot;neoliberal&quot; capitalism, because that&#039;s the system my country&#039;s been stuck in for nearly 40 years now and all it&#039;s done is made people suffer - for one, my generation is predicted to be the first to be &lt;i&gt;worse off&lt;/i&gt; than their parents. It also doesn&#039;t help that neoliberal capitalism has created a strong elite in Britain that refuses to pay taxes fairly (meaning that both ordinary people and public services suffer from poverty and poor performance), and because they control the media, they keep slagging off the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn at every waking moment because they&#039;re the strongest opposition against this bullshit, and the most likely party to get into government come next election. I&#039;d personally much rather have a &quot;mixed economy&quot; or Keynesian system where there is some state and private control over different services. ...Actually, this &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; the system Britain used to have, until Margaret Thatcher came along and it killed it off. &lt;img src=&quot;https://e.deviantart.net/emoticons/r/rolleyes.gif&quot; width=&quot;15&quot; height=&quot;15&quot; alt=&quot;:roll:&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;emoticon&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;393&quot; title=&quot;Roll Eyes&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point is, I&#039;m aware that capitalism has pros and cons. It&#039;s the most successful economic system because it&#039;s not excessive about the control of production, nor does it encourage protectionism and high tariffs. It&#039;s also one of the most destructive systems if not intervened with by the state, because thousands of people can be left in poverty if not supported by say, a welfare system. (Which is what is happening in Britain now sadly, yet the current Tory government doesn&#039;t give a shit.)

&lt;br /&gt;
I don&#039;t usually post my schoolwork, mostly because I don&#039;t much like any of it, but I think I&#039;d like to share this one, if I may ^_^&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For our Traditional Animation class, we were assigned to create a character, which we would then create a macquette (clay model) of for use as reference in the upcoming walk cycle assignment.  This is what I came up with, my version of the Loch Ness monster.  Och, I felt it was expected of me &lt;img src=&quot;http://e.deviantart.com/emoticons/letters/=p.gif&quot; width=&quot;15&quot; height=&quot;15&quot; alt=&quot;:P&quot; title=&quot;:P (Lick)&quot; /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In any case, I&#039;m fairly happy with it, though I must address a few flaws:  I realise the Braveheart facepaint does not include a white stripe and that that area is left blank, but Ness&#039;s complxion is so dark, it really wouldn&#039;t work to have just his skin showing through.  The tartan is also all wrong.  I&#039;d intended to replicate the MacGregor clan tartan, alas, I&#039;ve painted a good lot of this in the wee hours of the morning, a timeframe in which my little brain is quite subject to poopiness.  We&#039;ll just pretend it&#039;s a generic, non-specific tartan, shall we?  Lastly, the question of holding the bagpipes is addressed in the story below.  I modeled it that way because the pipes simply didn&#039;t work in front, over the shoulder where they should be.  They wouldn&#039;t fit.  Alas, I was forced to poisition them behind his arm.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many thanks to Clint and Jack for the generous donation of the chain, as well as the wire with which to make the armature.  Couldn&#039;t have done it without you, lads ^_^  ::huggs::&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Interesting bit of trivia;  The only well-lit place in our flat with a blank white wall for a background is our tiny matchbox of a kitchen, so I had to hunker down on my stomach on the kitchen floor (which is quite grody, as you can probably tell) to photograph him.  Many thanks also to Tiff for the use of your digital camera ^_^ ::huggs as well::&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
. . . Ah yes, and our character also has to have a story behind him/her/it.  This is what I wrote for class:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	Young Master Ness MacLoch, a fantastical reptilian was born and raised in the wilds of Inverness in the Scottish Highlands.  His kind prefers the shelter of the wooded wilderness and is mostly an aquatic sort, preferring to reside and dwell within dashing distance of water.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	He, himself was a rebellious laddie from the start and despite discouragement from his peace-loving vegan for a father and his gentle mother who enjoys the blissful quiet of her weekly knitting circle, he developed a fighter’s spirit and a keenness for the bagpipes.  His species is naturally equipped with a massive lung capacity for the deep diving they engage in to procure food, and Ness quickly realised that he was naturally equipped for piping and was determined to see this potential lived up to.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	In his early teens, Ness quickly grew bored with his pastoral existence.  One day, he packed up his pipes, took to the lake and embarked upon a long quest.  Southward bound, he hoped to reach England in order to give Margaret Thatcher a piece of his mind.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	However noble and heroic his efforts, Ness is not without his flaws.  Adjacent with his lust for adventure lies a store of arrogance and haste.  He is self-taught on the bagpipes, having refused the help of a teacher and while he can play well enough, he never learned the correct way of holding them.  In addition, he believes he is too good for maps and that the greatness in his destiny will lead him.  This was especially evident in his most memorable appearance where he arrived at Fort Augustus, thinking he had reached England.  The collective jaw of everyone present dropped in a moment of perfect drama as Ness emerged from the water, sporting the tartan and war paint of his ancestry and leading an army of his kindred, playing, “Blue Bonnets Over The Border.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	Today, Ness’s existence is shrouded in mystery.  Some say that his pigheadedness lead him all the way out to the ocean where he still remains to this day, hopelessly lost at sea..  Another rumour persists that he actually made it to his destination in secret, keeping a low profile.  One alleged witness claims to have seen him concealing himself with a trenchcoat, only to cast his disguise off and charge at Thatcher’s door like a battering ram with a mighty battle cry of “Russell Harty!”  Or perhaps he has converted to a much quieter existence, as one Amelia Nesbitt, 60, of Wales claims (she suspects him and his fellows of attempting to infiltrate her WI* meetings on more than one occasion).  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	We will continue to follow his story and keep you posted as sightings continue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
*For non-UKers, the WI is the Women&#039;s Institute, which is basically a little club of sorts for the older womenfolk.  Knitting, jumble sales, recipe-swappage, and basically the British equivalent of Tupperware parties &lt;img src=&quot;http://e.deviantart.com/emoticons/letters/=p.gif&quot; width=&quot;15&quot; height=&quot;15&quot; alt=&quot;:P&quot; title=&quot;:P (Lick)&quot; /&gt;</media:description>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/RJ647hPqqGEraVQ8xQNd1UkgSr0=/fit-in/150x150/filters:no_upscale():origin()/pre00/de9b/th/pre/i/2005/333/1/e/ness_macloch_by_princefala.jpg" height="144" width="150"/>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/czGr994KSc42XMEkfUjE8jxfUhs=/fit-in/300x900/filters:no_upscale():origin()/pre00/de9b/th/pre/i/2005/333/1/e/ness_macloch_by_princefala.jpg" height="289" width="300"/>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/pOMrBtGLUSsjbiiNxNC6vKDeHaE=/300x200/filters:fixed_height(100,100):origin()/pre00/de9b/th/pre/i/2005/333/1/e/ness_macloch_by_princefala.jpg" height="200" width="208"/>            <media:content url="https://pre00.deviantart.net/de9b/th/pre/i/2005/333/1/e/ness_macloch_by_princefala.jpg" height="877" width="911" medium="image"/>

This is what I came up with, my version of the Loch Ness monster.  Och, I felt it was expected of me &lt;img src=&quot;http://e.deviantart.com/emoticons/letters/=p.gif&quot; width=&quot;15&quot; height=&quot;15&quot; alt=&quot;:P&quot; title=&quot;:P (Lick)&quot; /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In any case, I&#039;m fairly happy with it, though I must address a few flaws:  I realise the Braveheart facepaint does not include a white stripe and that that area is left blank, but Ness&#039;s complxion is so dark, it really wouldn&#039;t work to have just his skin showing through.  The tartan is also all wrong.  I&#039;d intended to replicate the MacGregor clan tartan, alas, I&#039;ve painted a good lot of this in the wee hours of the morning, a timeframe in which my little brain is quite subject to poopiness.  We&#039;ll just pretend it&#039;s a generic, non-specific tartan, shall we?  Lastly, the question of holding the bagpipes is addressed in the story below.  I modeled it that way because the pipes simply didn&#039;t work in front, over the shoulder where they should be.  They wouldn&#039;t fit.  Alas, I was forced to poisition them behind his arm.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many thanks to Clint and Jack for the generous donation of the chain, as well as the wire with which to make the armature.  Couldn&#039;t have done it without you, lads ^_^  ::huggs::&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Interesting bit of trivia;  The only well-lit place in our flat with a blank white wall for a background is our tiny matchbox of a kitchen, so I had to hunker down on my stomach on the kitchen floor (which is quite grody, as you can probably tell) to photograph him.  Many thanks also to Tiff for the use of your digital camera ^_^ ::huggs as well::&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
. . . Ah yes, and our character also has to have a story behind him/her/it.  This is what I wrote for class:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	Young Master Ness MacLoch, a fantastical reptilian was born and raised in the wilds of Inverness in the Scottish Highlands.  His kind prefers the shelter of the wooded wilderness and is mostly an aquatic sort, preferring to reside and dwell within dashing distance of water.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	He, himself was a rebellious laddie from the start and despite discouragement from his peace-loving vegan for a father and his gentle mother who enjoys the blissful quiet of her weekly knitting circle, he developed a fighter’s spirit and a keenness for the bagpipes.  His species is naturally equipped with a massive lung capacity for the deep diving they engage in to procure food, and Ness quickly realised that he was naturally equipped for piping and was determined to see this potential lived up to.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	In his early teens, Ness quickly grew bored with his pastoral existence.  One day, he packed up his pipes, took to the lake and embarked upon a long quest.  Southward bound, he hoped to reach England in order to give Margaret Thatcher a piece of his mind.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	However noble and heroic his efforts, Ness is not without his flaws.  Adjacent with his lust for adventure lies a store of arrogance and haste.  He is self-taught on the bagpipes, having refused the help of a teacher and while he can play well enough, he never learned the correct way of holding them.  In addition, he believes he is too good for maps and that the greatness in his destiny will lead him.  This was especially evident in his most memorable appearance where he arrived at Fort Augustus, thinking he had reached England.  The collective jaw of everyone present dropped in a moment of perfect drama as Ness emerged from the water, sporting the tartan and war paint of his ancestry and leading an army of his kindred, playing, “Blue Bonnets Over The Border.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	Today, Ness’s existence is shrouded in mystery.  Some say that his pigheadedness lead him all the way out to the ocean where he still remains to this day, hopelessly lost at sea..  Another rumour persists that he actually made it to his destination in secret, keeping a low profile.  One alleged witness claims to have seen him concealing himself with a trenchcoat, only to cast his disguise off and charge at Thatcher’s door like a battering ram with a mighty battle cry of “Russell Harty!”  Or perhaps he has converted to a much quieter existence, as one Amelia Nesbitt, 60, of Wales claims (she suspects him and his fellows of attempting to infiltrate her WI* meetings on more than one occasion).  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	We will continue to follow his story and keep you posted as sightings continue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
*For non-UKers, the WI is the Women&#039;s Institute, which is basically a little club of sorts for the older womenfolk.  Knitting, jumble sales, recipe-swappage, and basically the British equivalent of Tupperware parties &lt;img src=&quot;http://e.deviantart.com/emoticons/letters/=p.gif&quot; width=&quot;15&quot; height=&quot;15&quot; alt=&quot;:P&quot; title=&quot;:P (Lick)&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://t00.deviantart.net/pOMrBtGLUSsjbiiNxNC6vKDeHaE=/300x200/filters:fixed_height(100,100):origin()/pre00/de9b/th/pre/i/2005/333/1/e/ness_macloch_by_princefala.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thumbnail&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>            </item>

Please be gentle with your comments, this is my first real project. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not die or lose interest in Deviantart after a week. This got so complicated for my low skill level it ended up taking four months, even though all I really did was steal and abuse vectors. It&#039;s been so long I can&#039;t tell if it&#039;s funny anymore.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was inspired by the &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://www.equestriadaily.com/2015/06/rainbow-dash-is-best-business-pony.html&quot;&gt;Business Pony&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;video on Equestria Daily.&amp;nbsp;It&#039;s a scene from the 1990&#039;s Dilbert&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;TV series, which is incredibly funny and it&#039;s a real shame that it wasn&#039;t picked up for a longer run. It&#039;s from the episode &quot;The Merger.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having spent so so so long on this, I can&#039;t resist giving a little commentary. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rainbow Dash has a green tie like the video. I stole it from&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chainchomp2.deviantart.com/art/Necktie-d-Doctor-Whooves-377244137&quot;&gt;Necktie&#039;d Doctor Whooves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. At first she was going to be the boss, but when I thought of Derpy instead I couldn&#039;t resist. It made perfect sense for her to play Dilbert&#039;s clueless, pointy-haired boss and Rainbow Dash the lazy Wally character.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got Derpy&#039;s grey power suit from &lt;a href=&quot;http://sircxyrtyx.deviantart.com/art/The-Legislative-Branch-287621071&quot;&gt;The Legislative Branch&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and her tie from &lt;a href=&quot;http://jrrhack.deviantart.com/art/Terra-Taupe-282956100&quot;&gt;Terra Taupe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twilight&#039;s outfit is from &lt;a href=&quot;http://sircxyrtyx.deviantart.com/art/The-Judicial-Branch-286385383&quot;&gt;The Judicial Branch&lt;/a&gt;. It seems like the plain, sensible sort of thing she would wear to the office. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applejack was going to wear &lt;a href=&quot;http://peachspices.deviantart.com/art/Pony-Teacher-220166443&quot;&gt;Pony Teacher&lt;/a&gt;&#039;s tie. But then I realized she absolutely had to have a bolo tie. I was inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;http://twiddlechimp.deviantart.com/art/Young-Braeburn-217005811&quot;&gt;Young Braeburn&lt;/a&gt;, but mine&#039;s not nearly as good as his. It&#039;s the first thing I ever made from scratch, and after that I got carried away. I started looking at&amp;nbsp;Mad Men secretaries. The conference room is based on Don Draper&#039;s office. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fluttershy&#039;s outfit is based on a display I saw in a department store window. Tying a black ribbon in a bow around your neck is popular in Japan. I stole her sleeves from &lt;a href=&quot;http://m99moron.deviantart.com/art/Seafoam-in-Canterlot-272485049&quot;&gt;Seafoam in Canterlot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pinkie Pie owes her look (bizarrely) to Margaret Thatcher. She&#039;s so bright, everything looked wrong on her. Then I thought of a loud 1980&#039;s pants suit. I based her jacket on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://piranhaplant1.deviantart.com/art/Surf-Vector-346599267&quot;&gt;Surf Vector&lt;/a&gt;. I took a&amp;nbsp;bow from the Crystal Prep uniform and distorted it to make it look more like a pussy bow. Margaret Thatcher wore a lot of them, so she became my #1 reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea what to do for Rarity. I wanted her to be Joan from Mad Men, so I gave her the earrings and pen necklace the pony version of Joan wears. I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://gurugrendo.deviantart.com/art/Rarity-s-Glasses-Vector-216392881&quot;&gt;Rarity&#039;s Glasses - Vector&lt;/a&gt;, and made my own for the side view. She&amp;nbsp;ended up with a kind of jabot dress. &amp;nbsp;I stole the ruffle from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://osipush.deviantart.com/art/Snowfall-Frost-609135051&quot;&gt;Snowfall Frost&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;made her pleated skirt by tracing her camping dress from &quot;Sleepless in Ponyville&quot; (I just decided not to worry about what&#039;s going on behind).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is incredibly difficult to make outfits for the weird pony bodies. I have profound respect for the artists on the show.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flamboyant style doesn&#039;t look like the horrible, dehumanizing Dilbert corporation or Mad Men any more. It looks a lot more like the 1970&#039;s, especially The Mary Tyler Moore Show. It&#039;s a perfect balance; it still has farcical office bureaucracy, where earning money could somehow be a problem. It&#039;s not as somber as Mad Men, but it has some absolutely fabulous fashion. 1970&#039;s style is totally due for a resurgence. The clocks are a direct reference to The Mary Tyler Moore Show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#039;s it. Not sure if it was worth it. Since I took advantage of so many people feel free to do what you like with it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#039;s every other deviation I mutilated (if you can&#039;t find something here I either made it myself or took it from a screencap):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derpy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tardifice.deviantart.com/art/Electric-Mane-539431620&quot;&gt;Electric Mane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://slb94.deviantart.com/art/What-In-The-Name-Of-Derp-541916690&quot;&gt;What In The Name Of Derp?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lman225.deviantart.com/art/Derpy-Hooves-request-458330401&quot;&gt;Derpy Hooves (request)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://derpyfanboy.deviantart.com/art/Angry-Derpy-216605468&quot;&gt;Angry Derpy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dashiesparkle.deviantart.com/art/Vector-187-Derpy-Hooves-5-538038532&quot;&gt;Vector #187 -

Please be gentle with your comments, this is my first real project. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not die or lose interest in Deviantart after a week. This got so complicated for my low skill level it ended up taking four months, even though all I really did was steal and abuse vectors. It&#039;s been so long I can&#039;t tell if it&#039;s funny anymore.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was inspired by the &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://www.equestriadaily.com/2015/06/rainbow-dash-is-best-business-pony.html&quot;&gt;Business Pony&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;video on Equestria Daily.&amp;nbsp;It&#039;s a scene from the 1990&#039;s Dilbert&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;TV series, which is incredibly funny and it&#039;s a real shame that it wasn&#039;t picked up for a longer run. It&#039;s from the episode &quot;The Merger.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having spent so so so long on this, I can&#039;t resist giving a little commentary. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rainbow Dash has a green tie like the video. I stole it from&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chainchomp2.deviantart.com/art/Necktie-d-Doctor-Whooves-377244137&quot;&gt;Necktie&#039;d Doctor Whooves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. At first she was going to be the boss, but when I thought of Derpy instead I couldn&#039;t resist. It made perfect sense for her to play Dilbert&#039;s clueless, pointy-haired boss and Rainbow Dash the lazy Wally character.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got Derpy&#039;s grey power suit from &lt;a href=&quot;http://sircxyrtyx.deviantart.com/art/The-Legislative-Branch-287621071&quot;&gt;The Legislative Branch&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and her tie from &lt;a href=&quot;http://jrrhack.deviantart.com/art/Terra-Taupe-282956100&quot;&gt;Terra Taupe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twilight&#039;s outfit is from &lt;a href=&quot;http://sircxyrtyx.deviantart.com/art/The-Judicial-Branch-286385383&quot;&gt;The Judicial Branch&lt;/a&gt;. It seems like the plain, sensible sort of thing she would wear to the office. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applejack was going to wear &lt;a href=&quot;http://peachspices.deviantart.com/art/Pony-Teacher-220166443&quot;&gt;Pony Teacher&lt;/a&gt;&#039;s tie. But then I realized she absolutely had to have a bolo tie. I was inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;http://twiddlechimp.deviantart.com/art/Young-Braeburn-217005811&quot;&gt;Young Braeburn&lt;/a&gt;, but mine&#039;s not nearly as good as his. It&#039;s the first thing I ever made from scratch, and after that I got carried away. I started looking at&amp;nbsp;Mad Men secretaries. The conference room is based on Don Draper&#039;s office. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fluttershy&#039;s outfit is based on a display I saw in a department store window. Tying a black ribbon in a bow around your neck is popular in Japan. I stole her sleeves from &lt;a href=&quot;http://m99moron.deviantart.com/art/Seafoam-in-Canterlot-272485049&quot;&gt;Seafoam in Canterlot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pinkie Pie owes her look (bizarrely) to Margaret Thatcher. She&#039;s so bright, everything looked wrong on her. Then I thought of a loud 1980&#039;s pants suit. I based her jacket on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://piranhaplant1.deviantart.com/art/Surf-Vector-346599267&quot;&gt;Surf Vector&lt;/a&gt;. I took a&amp;nbsp;bow from the Crystal Prep uniform and distorted it to make it look more like a pussy bow. Margaret Thatcher wore a lot of them, so she became my #1 reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea what to do for Rarity. I wanted her to be Joan from Mad Men, so I gave her the earrings and pen necklace the pony version of Joan wears. I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://gurugrendo.deviantart.com/art/Rarity-s-Glasses-Vector-216392881&quot;&gt;Rarity&#039;s Glasses - Vector&lt;/a&gt;, and made my own for the side view. She&amp;nbsp;ended up with a kind of jabot dress. &amp;nbsp;I stole the ruffle from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://osipush.deviantart.com/art/Snowfall-Frost-609135051&quot;&gt;Snowfall Frost&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;made her pleated skirt by tracing her camping dress from &quot;Sleepless in Ponyville&quot; (I just decided not to worry about what&#039;s going on behind).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is incredibly difficult to make outfits for the weird pony bodies. I have profound respect for the artists on the show.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flamboyant style doesn&#039;t look like the horrible, dehumanizing Dilbert corporation or Mad Men any more. It looks a lot more like the 1970&#039;s, especially The Mary Tyler Moore Show. It&#039;s a perfect balance; it still has farcical office bureaucracy, where earning money could somehow be a problem. It&#039;s not as somber as Mad Men, but it has some absolutely fabulous fashion. 1970&#039;s style is totally due for a resurgence. The clocks are a direct reference to The Mary Tyler Moore Show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#039;s it. Not sure if it was worth it. Since I took advantage of so many people feel free to do what you like with it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#039;s every other deviation I mutilated (if you can&#039;t find something here I either made it myself or took it from a screencap):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derpy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tardifice.deviantart.com/art/Electric-Mane-539431620&quot;&gt;Electric Mane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://slb94.deviantart.com/art/What-In-The-Name-Of-Derp-541916690&quot;&gt;What In The Name Of Derp?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lman225.deviantart.com/art/Derpy-Hooves-request-458330401&quot;&gt;Derpy Hooves (request)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://derpyfanboy.deviantart.com/art/Angry-Derpy-216605468&quot;&gt;Angry Derpy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dashiesparkle.deviantart.com/art/Vector-187-Derpy-Hooves-5-538038532&quot;&gt;Vector #187 -

Well it&#039;s not the full role here but it&#039;s a glimpse of her contribution to events. I won&#039;t go into the whole rhyme and reason she appears - you can get the whole story yourself in the original issues or the collections there are on the market. It&#039;s a great story - I&#039;m sure you won&#039;t be disappointed by it if you seek it out. &lt;br /&gt;Artistically, this one was a really liberating experience for me. Unlike the experience with War Stories and it&#039;s restricting need to stick to accurate reference most of the time, this much earlier work needed nothing apart from some basic reference material. And technically it was freeing too, because I just used permanent markers, fine liners and black crayon on very rough pencils. There was no particular reason I did this - I did it just because I could, and felt able to, and knew that it wouldn&#039;t be detrimental to the atmosphere or dramatic value of the art and storytelling. In the event, I think it enhanced it, giving a ragged, primitive look to what is after all a story about people in a modern world reverting to a kind of ancient savagery. The frame shapes and layout here is an example of what I&#039;ve done on a number of stories, including other Hellblazer projects, in order to tip the action into surrealism, distortion or horrific incident. Preceding these sequences in scenes of &#039; normality &#039; the frames were simply ordered rectangles.</media:description>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/uzH2Mxbd1O_9ZCMTYeTkzKktOoc=/fit-in/150x150/filters:no_upscale():origin()/pre00/dd2e/th/pre/i/2010/082/9/2/hellblazer_26_p5_by_lforlloyd.jpg" height="150" width="98"/>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/a7YIzIkleAsuxOcdgXC3HggEMgM=/fit-in/300x900/filters:no_upscale():origin()/pre00/dd2e/th/pre/i/2010/082/9/2/hellblazer_26_p5_by_lforlloyd.jpg" height="457" width="300"/>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/inwYBgAu2WuL-t0k14qAC_xoWqw=/300x200/filters:fixed_height(100,100):origin()/pre00/dd2e/th/pre/i/2010/082/9/2/hellblazer_26_p5_by_lforlloyd.jpg" height="200" width="131"/>            <media:content url="https://pre00.deviantart.net/dd2e/th/pre/i/2010/082/9/2/hellblazer_26_p5_by_lforlloyd.jpg" height="1103" width="724" medium="image"/>

It&#039;s a great story - I&#039;m sure you won&#039;t be disappointed by it if you seek it out. &lt;br /&gt;Artistically, this one was a really liberating experience for me. Unlike the experience with War Stories and it&#039;s restricting need to stick to accurate reference most of the time, this much earlier work needed nothing apart from some basic reference material. And technically it was freeing too, because I just used permanent markers, fine liners and black crayon on very rough pencils. There was no particular reason I did this - I did it just because I could, and felt able to, and knew that it wouldn&#039;t be detrimental to the atmosphere or dramatic value of the art and storytelling. In the event, I think it enhanced it, giving a ragged, primitive look to what is after all a story about people in a modern world reverting to a kind of ancient savagery. The frame shapes and layout here is an example of what I&#039;ve done on a number of stories, including other Hellblazer projects, in order to tip the action into surrealism, distortion or horrific incident. Preceding these sequences in scenes of &#039; normality &#039; the frames were simply ordered rectangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://t00.deviantart.net/inwYBgAu2WuL-t0k14qAC_xoWqw=/300x200/filters:fixed_height(100,100):origin()/pre00/dd2e/th/pre/i/2010/082/9/2/hellblazer_26_p5_by_lforlloyd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thumbnail&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>            </item>

In other words, he is simply us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Internet: without this you wouldn’t be able to reads these words or ever view anything you see around them, it has shaped the world in ways no one could dream for both good and bad and made the world that little bit closer to each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hammer and Sickle: Communist symbol of the unity between industrial and agricultural workers in the fight for a better world, were all People’s are United under the ideas of social and economic justice.&lt;br /&gt;The Future: It where we are going to spend the rest of our lives so we need to plan for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas Sankara: Commonly referred to as &quot;Africa&#039;s Che Guevara, Sankara was President of Burkina Faso from 1983 to 1987 His policies were focused on preventing famine with agrarian self-sufficiency and land reform, prioritizing education with a nation-wide literacy campaign, and promoting public health by vaccinating 2.5 million children against meningitis, yellow fever and measles. Other components of his national agenda included planting over ten million trees to halt the growing desertification of the Sahel, doubling wheat production by redistributing land from feudal landlords to peasants, suspending rural poll taxes and domestic rents, and establishing an ambitious road and rail construction program to &quot;tie the nation together.&quot; Moreover, his commitment to women&#039;s rights led him to outlaw female genital mutilation, forced marriages and polygamy; while appointing females to high governmental positions and encouraging them to work outside the home and stay in school even if pregnant. Sadly he was overthrown and assassinated in a French-backed coup d&#039;éta,t in 1987, A week before his execution he declared that, &quot;While revolutionaries as individuals can be murdered, you cannot kill ideas&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Constructivism: an Art movement that originated in Russia from 1919 onwards, it rejected the idea of &quot;art for art&#039;s sake&quot; in favour of art as a practice directed towards social purposes. Its motifs have sporadically recurred in other art movements ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steam locomotives: Something I have loved since I was a child, steam locomotives, have been around for the last 200 hundred years (give or take) used for a wide range of jobs, even with new diesel and electric locomotives, they can still capture the heart of anyone of any age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salvador Allende: first democratically elected Marxist to become president of a state in the Americas in 1970, Allende carried out a widespread programme of nationalisation and introduced a state system of health care and other radical measures to help the poor. &lt;br /&gt;But foreign capital wasn&#039;t happy and Allende was toppled by a military coup in which he lost his life in 1973 and which brought the fascist dictator and friend of Margaret Thatcher, General Augusto Pinochet to power. &lt;br /&gt;In his last address to the people, Allende declared: &quot;Workers of my country, I have faith in Chile and its destiny. Other men will overcome this dark and bitter moment when treason seeks to prevail. &lt;br /&gt;&quot;Keep in mind that, much sooner than later, the great avenues will again be opened through which will pass free men to construct a better society. Long live Chile! Long live the people! Long live the workers!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hugo Chavez: The inspirational President of Venezuela, Chavez is a hero for the way he governs his country in the interests of the majority and for his outspoken opposition to the neoconservative war agenda. &lt;br /&gt;Earlier this year Chavez declared: &quot;Every factory must be a school to educate, like Che Guevara said, to produce not only briquettes, steel, and aluminium but also above all the new man and woman, the new society, the socialist society&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friedrich Engels: After seeing the the suffering the Working class of Manchester during his time there, Engels became co founder of communism, alongside Karl Marx, he produced The Communist Manifesto in 1848 and later edited the second and third volumes of Das Kapital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May Day: International Workers&#039; Day, where Labour is celebrated. It is a national holiday in more than 80 countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feminism: I am also a feminist in many ways as I believe that women and men should be equal in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proletariat: The Builders of the world, who run the means of production, they have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Che Guevara: Argentine Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, intellectual, guerrilla leader, diplomat, military theorist, and major figure of the Cuban Revolution, As a medical student, Guevara traveled throughout Latin America and was transformed by the endemic poverty he witnessed. His experiences and observations during these trips led him to conclude that the region&#039;s ingrained economic inequalities were an intrinsic result of capitalism, monopolism, neocolonialism, and imperialism, with the only remedy being world revolution. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;World Peace: Because only when we have peace can we have progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fidel Castro: President of Cuba from 1976 2008, Castro lead the Cuban Revolution that which overthrew the US backed dictatorship of Batista, since then he has been a target of US imperialism with 638 assassination schemes or attempts against him, along with 50 years of US backed terrorism against Cuba, despite all of this Castro has helped build one of the best Health and education systems in the world and remains an icon the world over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karl Marx: Arguably one the Influential of all time, Marx’s ideas played a significant role in the development of modern communism and socialism and wrote one of the best critics of Capitalism in modern history.</media:description>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/nBcATndrVAakMc7muAkh7YMl808=/fit-in/150x150/filters:no_upscale():origin()/pre00/5072/th/pre/i/2010/288/4/7/my_influence_map_by_party9999999-d30t3tw.png" height="150" width="118"/>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/nFDIc7IrcK8uzTTfRniBHZsQQIk=/fit-in/300x900/filters:no_upscale():origin()/pre00/5072/th/pre/i/2010/288/4/7/my_influence_map_by_party9999999-d30t3tw.png" height="380" width="300"/>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/9uTx6RNlrzXTHEEEGQym4ESoSqE=/300x200/filters:fixed_height(100,100):origin()/pre00/5072/th/pre/i/2010/288/4/7/my_influence_map_by_party9999999-d30t3tw.png" height="200" width="158"/>            <media:content url="https://pre00.deviantart.net/5072/th/pre/i/2010/288/4/7/my_influence_map_by_party9999999-d30t3tw.png" height="1007" width="794" medium="image"/>

After Disraeli rose to power, the Conservative government put through social welfare legislation. Prior to his ascendance to power, Disraeli as a member of the Conservative Party, criticized the party at that time for failing recognize the important issue that social division between the extreme rich and extreme poor threatened the possibility of social unrest and disorder that at its worst could result in extreme class violence like that of the Reign of Terror period of the French Revolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concern over social unrest held by Disraeli was addressed amidst radical movements arising calling for the working class to have a revolution to overthrow the wealthy and the capitalist economy they benefited from, first with anarchists and then several years after this quote in 1848 communism arose in Britain with the German economists Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels living in Britain publishing The Communist Manifesto that year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disraeli&#039;s stance became the platform of the Conservative Party when Disraeli became the party&#039;s leader and onward, influencing many conservative figures abroad who emulated these policies, such as German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, American Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, amongst many others. In Britian, One Nation conservatism remained the standing policy until Margaret Thatcher moved the party away from that towards neoliberal conservatism (or neoconservatism) that declared that government expenditures needed to be dramatically cut for Britain to balance its budgets and to repay debt, including through substantially reduce government intervention in the economy as well as substantially reducing the size of the welfare state. However in Britain, appeals to Disraeli&#039;s One Nation concept are currently being made by both the Conservative Party (that has sought to distance itself from the controversial neoliberal elements of the Thatcher era) and the Labour Party, both contending to be considered Disraeli&#039;s proper heir in recognizing that economic inequality has to addressed to ensure the unity and stability of a country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original source that I copied the quote from: &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/disraeli/diniejko3.html&quot;&gt;www.victorianweb.org/authors/d&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Note 1:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Although contemporary Western usage of the word &quot;progressive&quot; may make the name of the political party he was in seem like an oxymoron, the meaning of &quot;progressive&quot; in the past had a broader usage. In the Conservative Party of Britain there were followers of Benjamin Disraeli&#039;s One Nation conservatism that supported insuring that the level of inequality between the rich and poor did not reach the point that would result in civil unrest breaking out from radicals agitating the lower classes. Also American President Theodore Roosevelt publicly called himself both a progressive and a conservative and advocated similar policies to Disraeli. Also these conservatives supported social welfare as a means to help people specifically during bad economic conditions, though by the 1970s and 1980s they came under political pressure for fiscal restraint on social welfare but they rejected more radical calls for drastic repeal of social welfare.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Note 2:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Although contemporary Western usage of the words &quot;conservative&quot;&amp;nbsp; and &quot;liberal&quot; have been used as opposed to each other in fact many self-described conservative movements are in fact conservative liberal movements in that they promote core values of liberal political philosophy.

                <media:description type="html">BAC TSR-2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TSR-2 XR220 in Anti-flash white finish&lt;br /&gt;Type Tactical Strike / Reconnaissance&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturer British Aircraft Corporation&lt;br /&gt;Maiden flight 27 September 1964&lt;br /&gt;Status Project cancelled&lt;br /&gt;Number built 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BAC TSR-2 was an ill-fated Cold War strike aircraft developed by the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) for the Royal Air Force (RAF) in the early 1960s. The TSR-2 was designed to penetrate a well-defended forward battle area at low altitudes and very high speeds, and then attack high-value targets in the rear with close-in bomb runs and precision drops. The TSR-2 included a number of advanced features that made it the highest performing aircraft in this role, yet the programme was controversially cancelled in favour of the General Dynamics F-111, a procurement that itself was later cancelled.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#147; All modern aircraft have four dimensions: span, length, height and politics. TSR-2 simply got the first three right. &amp;#148;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#151; Sir Sydney Camm&lt;br /&gt;Contents&lt;br /&gt;[hide]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* 1 Development&lt;br /&gt;o 1.1 Background&lt;br /&gt;o 1.2 GOR 339&lt;br /&gt;o 1.3 Political changes&lt;br /&gt;o 1.4 Submissions&lt;br /&gt;o 1.5 The mission&lt;br /&gt;* 2 Design&lt;br /&gt;* 3 Operational history&lt;br /&gt;o 3.1 Testing&lt;br /&gt;o 3.2 Project cancellation&lt;br /&gt;* 4 Survivors&lt;br /&gt;* 5 Specifications&lt;br /&gt;* 6 See also&lt;br /&gt;* 7 References&lt;br /&gt;o 7.1 Notes&lt;br /&gt;o 7.2 Bibliography&lt;br /&gt;* 8 External links&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Background&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to the TSR-2 effort, the British Royal Air Force had deployed the English Electric Canberra bomber, capable of flying at high altitudes and relatively high speeds. Like the de Havilland Mosquito before it, the Canberra carried no defensive weapons and relied on its high performance to allow it to avoid defenses. Fighters could approach the speeds of the Canberra, but doing so while climbing to its altitude was by no means a trivial task. Nevertheless, as the performance of the Soviet interceptors grew, the Canberra grew increasingly vulnerable. English Electric had been studying higher performance designs, otherwise similar to the Canberra, since even before the Canberra entered service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The introduction of the radar-guided surface-to-air missile (SAM) significantly upset this balance. SAMs attacked in a straight line from below, and had speed and altitude performance much greater than any contemporary aircraft. The Canberra, and other high-altitude aircraft like the Avro Vulcan or B-52 Stratofortress, were extremely vulnerable to these weapons. The solution was to fly lower. Since radar operates in line-of-sight, an aircraft flying at 200 ft (60 m) only becomes visible at about 25 miles (40 km) distance. An aircraft traveling just under Mach 1, say Mach 0.85 or 650 mph (1046 km/h), will cover this distance in a little over two minutes, giving the SAM site very little time to prepare for an attack. This also assumes a perfectly smooth Earth; trees, hills, valleys and any other obstructions reduce this range even more, making an attack extremely difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Canberra was designed for high-altitude flight and could not be easily flown at lower altitudes. In particular its large wings would result in high loads due to turbulence. Additionally, navigation at low altitudes is a demanding task, one that the 1940s era electronics of the Canberra was simply not up to. Low-level strike fighters, or &quot;interdictors&quot; as they became known, grew into a new class of their own through the late 1950s. They generally featured high wing loading to reduce the effects of turbulence, some form of high performance navigational radar to allow them to fly very low at high speeds, and large fuel loads to offset the higher fuel use at low altitudes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOR 339&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aware of these issues, the Ministry of Supply started work with English Electric in 1956, attempting to define a new interdictor. Originally the designs concentrated on a smaller aircraft more similar to a fighter, and there was some discussion of developing the P.1B project (soon to become the English Electric Lightning) in this direction as the P.18, while adaptations of the earlier developments of the Canberra were gathered under the P.17 designation. These early studies eventually settled on an aircraft with a 2,000 nm (3,700 km) ferry range, Mach 1.5 speed &quot;at altitude&quot;, and VTOL or STOL performance. The latter requirement was a side-effect of common battle plans from the 1950s, which suggested that nuclear strikes in the opening stages of war would damage most runways and airbases, meaning that aircraft would need to take off from improvised sites, or even fields. As the project continued, the requirements continued to grow. A crew of two was required, one operating the advanced navigational and attack equipment, and bombload was six 1,000 lb (450 kg) bombs. This basically eliminated the P.18 design as a suitable approach, and further work concentrated solely on the delta-wing P.17A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The requirements were eventually made official in March 1957 with GOR (General Operational Requirement) 339. This specification was exceptionally ambitious for the technology of the day, requiring a supersonic all-weather aircraft that could deliver nuclear weapons over a long range, operate at high level at Mach 2+ or low level at Mach 1.2, with a short takeoff ability from rough and ready airstrips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specifically the requirement included:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* deliver tactical nuclear weapons at low level in all weathers.&lt;br /&gt;* photo-reconnaissance at medium and low levels day and night&lt;br /&gt;* electronic reconnaissance&lt;br /&gt;* deliver tactical nuclear weapons day and night at medium altitudes blind bombing if necessary&lt;br /&gt;* deliver conventional bombs and rockets&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low level was stated to be under 1,000 ft (300 m) with an expected attack speed at sea-level of Mach 0.95. The operational range was to be 1,000 nautical miles (1,850 km) operating off runways of no more than 3,000 ft (900 m).[1]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Political changes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this specification was being studied by various manufacturers, the first of the political storms that were to dog the project reared its head, when Defence Minister Duncan Sandys stated in the 1957 Defence White Paper the era of manned combat was at an end and ballistic missiles were the weapons of the future. Within a decade, this philosophy became thoroughly discredited, but at the time, and in the climate of the Cold War and &quot;mutual deterrence&quot;, it doubtless appeared to make some sense, especially as it seemed missiles would offer significant cost savings over manned aircraft. Debate over the need for GOR 339 in light of the White Paper continued for some time, but it was eventually allowed to continue as one of the projects that was &quot;too far along&quot; to cancel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with this was the uncertainty caused by the House of Commons Select Committee on Estimates&amp;#039; report of the year prior. This report suggested that contracts should only be accepted from teams consisting of more than one company, in order to force the companies to merge. Although the large number of companies in the UK at the time was a problem, the Committee&amp;#039;s solution to the problem led to various problems when teams that had never even spoken before were forced to work together for no reason other than to have a chance of winning work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another political matter that did not help was the mutual distrust between the various services. At the time GOR 339 was being defined the Royal Navy was in the midst of their NA.39 project, which would eventually become the Blackburn Buccaneer. The Buc was also a low-altitude high-speed attack aircraft, but designed for overwater contrary to overland use. The savings involved in both forces using a common aircraft would be considerable, and Blackburn offered the RAF a supersonic version of the NA.39 to fit the GOR 339 requirements. However, the RAF rebuffed the proposal, stating that anything under Mach 2 performance was unsatisfactory, and S/VTOL performance was mandatory. As one RAF official put it, &quot;If we show the slightest interest in NA.39 we might not get the GOR.339 aircraft.&quot;[2]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Submissions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Work on GOR 339 continued, with a deadline for submissions on 31 January 1958. A large number of proposals were entered; EE&amp;#039;s P.17A along with designs from Avro, Hawker and Vickers-Armstrong (through their Supermarine division). Short Brothers also sent in the P.17D, a flying platform that was to be used in concert with the P.17A, lifting it into the air so that the P.17 did not have to have VTOL performance on its own. The Air Ministry eventually selected the EE P.17A and the Supermarine 571 for further development. The Ministry was particularly impressed with the Vickers submission, which included not only the aircraft design, but a &quot;total systems concept&quot; which outlined all the support facilities and logistics needed to support the aircraft in the field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOR 339 was revealed to the public in December 1958 in a statement to the House of Commons. Under pressure by the recommendations of the Committee on Estimates, the Air Ministry examined ways that the various project proposals could be combined, and in January 1959 the Minister of Supply announced that the TSR-2 would be built by Vickers-Armstrong working with English Electric; the initials coming from &quot;Tactical Strike and Reconnaissance 2&quot;.[1]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On 1 January 1959 the project was given an official go-ahead under the new designation OR (Operational Requirement) 343. OR 343 was more specific and built upon work from the various submissions to GOR 339 specifically stating that the low level operations would be at 200 ft or less, and that Mach 2 should be attained at altitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The mission&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The envisioned &quot;standard mission&quot; for the TSR-2 was to carry a 2,000 lb (900 kg) weapon internally for a combat radius of 1,000 nautical miles (nm) (1,850 km). Of that mission 100 nm (185 km) was to be flown at higher altitudes at Mach 1.7 and the 200 nm (370 km) into and out of the target area was to be flown as low as 200 feet (60 m) at Mach 0.95. The rest of the mission was to be flown at Mach 0.92. If the entire mission were to be flown at the low 200-ft altitude, the mission radius was reduced to 700 nm (1,300 km). Heavier weapons loads could be carried with further reductions in range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extensions to the TSR-2&amp;#039;s range were planned to be made by fitting external tanks &amp;#151; one 450-Imperial gallon (2,000 L) tank under each wing or one 1,000 Imperial gallon (4,500 L) tank carried centrally below the fuselage. If no internal weapons were carried, a further 570 Imperial gallons (2,600 L) could be carried in a tank in the weapons bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was also planned to be able to equip the TSR-2 with a reconnaissance pack in the weapons bay which, coupled to the aircraft&amp;#039;s capable sideways looking radar (SLAR), would have turned the aircraft into a formidable &quot;recon&quot; asset not unlike the contemporary North American RA-5C of the United States Navy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;English Electric, manufacturer of the Canberra, and Vickers-Armstrongs had been judged to have made the best submissions for GOR 339. The two companies combined their ideas for the specification and put forward their joint design with a view to an aircraft flying by 1963. No order was forthcoming and by the time the Ministry had made a decision the various companies had been amalgamated as the British Aircraft Corporation in 1960. EE had put forward a delta winged design and Vickers a swept wing on a long fuselage. The EE wing, born of their greater supersonic experience, was judged superior to Vickers, while the Vickers fuselage was preferred. In effect, the aircraft would be built 50/50: Vickers the front half, EE the back.[1]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design was a large aircraft to be powered by two Bristol-Siddeley Olympus afterburning turbojets, with a large shoulder-mounted slab-wing with down-turned tips, an all-moving swept tailplane and a large all-moving fin. The engines were a variant of those used in the Avro Vulcan, and would later be developed further for Concorde. It is often stated, incorrectly, that the leading designer of the TSR-2 was Vickers&amp;#039; Barnes Wallis, the legendary aeronautical engineer famous for his Wellington bomber design and contribution to the Dambusters raids. Wallis was not involved in the TSR-2, but his son, who also worked for Vickers, was involved with it to a small extent. In fact Wallis was quite critical of the TSR-2, and stated that a &quot;swing-wing&quot; design (a concept that he championed, having done much work on it) would be more appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design featured blown flaps to achieve the short takeoff and landing requirement, something that later designs would achieve with the technically more complex swing-wing approach. The aircraft featured some extremely sophisticated avionics for navigation and mission delivery &amp;#151; far ahead of anything else available at the time &amp;#151; which would also prove to be one of the reasons for the spiraling costs of the project. Some features, such as ground-following terrain radar, FLIR cameras, side-looking airborne radar and the sophisticated autopilot, only became commonplace on military aircraft later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wing loading was high for its time, enabling the aircraft to fly at very high speed and low level with great stability without being constantly upset by thermals and other ground-related weather phenomena. This in turn made the innovative ground-following radar and autopilot system feasible. To improve the ride quality at low levels further, the cockpit had a degree of &quot;float&quot; to help damp out turbulence and reduce crew fatigue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were considerable problems with realizing the design. Some contributing manufacturers were employed directly by the Ministry rather than through BAC, and the Ministry itself took on design tasks, with the usual long deliberations and meetings typical of civil servants.[3]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Operational history&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Testing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the increasing costs (which were inevitable, given the low original estimates), two prototype aircraft were completed. Test pilot Roland Beamont made the first flight on 27 September 1964. In the course of testing, the TSR-2 was found to meet easily the demanding GOR 339 performance specification. Aerodynamically the aircraft was trouble-free, but there were continual problems with the engines and the undercarriage. Indeed, the engines delivered for the first aircraft did not fit, leading to delays for the first flight which meant that the TSR-2 missed the opportunity to be displayed to the public at that year&amp;#039;s Farnborough Air Show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial flight tests were all performed with the undercarriage down and engine power strictly limited. Only on the tenth test flight was the landing gear successfully retracted, but vibration problems on landing persisted. The aircraft&amp;#039;s nosegear vibrated at the resonance frequency of the eyeball, causing the pilot and navigator to suffer double vision during taxiing. The problem was dealt with by adding damping into the already extremely complex landing gear. The second prototype (XR220) incorporated additional dampers in the main gear legs (fixed dampers having been flight tested on XR219).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first supersonic test flight (Flight 14), was achieved on the transfer from the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at Boscombe Down to BAC Warton. Surprisingly, the aircraft achieved Mach 1 on dry power only (supercruise). Following this, test pilot Beamont lit one of the afterburners only (because of problems with the other engine&amp;#039;s afterburner fuel pump), with the result that the aircraft accelerated away from the chase Lightning despite its engaging full afterburner on both engines.[3]A speed of Mach 1.2 was reached on that occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a period of six months many test flights were conducted. None of the complex electronics were fitted to the first prototype, so these flights were all concerned with the basic flying qualities of the aircraft, which according to the test pilot involved, were outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Project cancellation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The United States had developed the swing-wing General Dynamics F-111 project as a follow-on to the F-105 Thunderchief, a fast low-level bomber designed in the 1950s with an internal bay for a nuclear weapon. As a cost-saving measure over developing a duplicate aircraft, the RAF considered the F-111 as an alternative. In response to suggestions of cancellation BAC employees held a protest march, and the new Labour government, which came to power in 1964, issued strong denials. But in the budget speech of 6 April 1965, the cancellation in favour of the F-111 was announced. A week later the Chancellor defended the decision in a debate in the House of Commons, saying that the F-111 would prove cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;One of the surviving airframes at the RAF Museum, Cosford&lt;br /&gt;One of the surviving airframes at the RAF Museum, Cosford&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TSR-2 tooling and partially completed aircraft were scrapped. Two finished but unflown aircraft eventually survived, though with substantial internal damage inflicted; XR220 at the RAF Museum, Cosford near Wolverhampton, and XR222 at the Imperial War Museum Duxford. A number of unfinished airframes were hastily scrapped, with very few parts retained intact. Along with two unfinished frames (XR221 and XR223), the only airframe ever to fly, XR219, was taken to Shoeburyness and used as a target to test the vulnerability of a modern airframe and systems to gunfire.[3] The haste with which the project was scrapped has been the source of much argument and bitterness since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To replace the TSR-2 the Ministry decided on two aircraft, one would be the swing-wing American General Dynamics F-111K for the strike reconnaissance role with a longer-term replacement being a joint Anglo-French project for a variable geometry strike aircraft, dubbed AFVG.[1] However, the F-111K itself suffered enormous cost escalation, far exceeding that of the TSR-2 projection, and many technical problems before its successful deployment in combat. Coupled with a poorer than projected performance and the devaluation of the pound, the order for 50 F-111Ks for the RAF was cancelled and instead they took on the F-4 Phantom II and the Blackburn Buccaneer, some of which were transferred from the Royal Navy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were the very same aircraft that the RAF had apparently derided in order to get the TSR-2 go-ahead, but the Buccaneer proved capable and was still in service into the early 1990s. The TSR-2 nonetheless remains a lingering &quot;what if?&quot; of British aviation, like the CF-105 Arrow interceptor in Canada. The Phantom and Buccaneer were eventually replaced by the variable-geometry Panavia Tornado, a much smaller design than either the F-111 or the TSR-2. Experience in the design and development of the avionics, particularly the terrain-following capabilities, were used on the later Tornado programme. The Soviet Union also developed swing-wing fighters and strike bombers in the late 1960s and 1970s. The Royal Australian Air Force adopted the F-111, and continues to fly them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A government study into the feasibility of resurrecting the TSR-2 project was carried out during the early 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister.[citation needed] There was, briefly, some speculation that TSR-2 might yet see the light of day in an updated form.[citation needed] But after the study concluded that it would be far too expensive (the previous destruction requiring a complete start from scratch), and that the technology was no longer cutting edge, the TSR-2 was cancelled forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[edit] Survivors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* XR220 (X-02) is on display at the RAF Museum Cosford, England.&lt;br /&gt;* XR222 (X-04) is on display at the Imperial War Museum Duxford, England.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Specifications&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General characteristics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Crew: 2&lt;br /&gt;* Length: 89 ft &amp;#189; in (27.12 m)&lt;br /&gt;* Wingspan: 37 ft 1&amp;#190; in (11.27 m)&lt;br /&gt;* Height: 23 ft 9 in (7.24 m)&lt;br /&gt;* Wing area: 702.9 ft&amp;#178; (65.3 m&amp;#178;&lt;img src=&quot;https://e.deviantart.net/emoticons/w/wink.gif&quot; width=&quot;15&quot; height=&quot;15&quot; alt=&quot;;)&quot; title=&quot;;) (Wink)&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Empty weight: 54,750 lb (24,834 kg)&lt;br /&gt;* Loaded weight: 79,573 lb (36,169 kg)&lt;br /&gt;* Max takeoff weight: 102,200 lb (46,357 kg)&lt;br /&gt;* Powerplant: 2&amp;#215; Bristol-Siddeley Olympus BOl.22R (Mk. 320) turbojet&lt;br /&gt;o Dry thrust: 19,610 lb (87.23 kN) each&lt;br /&gt;o Thrust with afterburner: 30,610 lbf (136.7 kN) each&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Maximum speed: Mach 2.15&lt;br /&gt;* Range: 1,150 (1,850 km)&lt;br /&gt;* Service ceiling 54,000 ft (16,459 m)&lt;br /&gt;* Rate of climb: 50,000 ft/min[citation needed] (16,000 m/min)&lt;br /&gt;* Thrust/weight: 0.77&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armament&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Internal weapons bay, 20 ft (6 m) with 1 Red Beard (nuclear) or 6 x 1,000 lb (450 kg) HE bombs,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* or 4 x 37 rocket packs or nuclear weaponry on inner pylons only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maximum of 20,000 lbs (9,000 kg) of bombs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avionics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Autonetics Verdan autopilot modified by Elliot Automation&lt;br /&gt;* Ferranti (terrain following radar and navigation/attack systems)&lt;br /&gt;* EMI (sideways looking radar)&lt;br /&gt;* Marconi (general avionics)&lt;br /&gt;* Cossor (IFF)&lt;br /&gt;* Plessey (Radio)</media:description>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/TpZfLIa2PhNss9IQkT2HsEdBIKg=/fit-in/150x150/filters:no_upscale():origin()/pre00/2d0c/th/pre/f/2009/252/4/a/bac_tsr_2_by_bagera3005.png" height="147" width="150"/>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/5WMO42E7y44LTvt4CQsqFZ_VqOs=/fit-in/300x900/filters:no_upscale():origin()/pre00/2d0c/th/pre/f/2009/252/4/a/bac_tsr_2_by_bagera3005.png" height="293" width="300"/>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/lEZ885NkFbICdF40hJkgNLReawA=/300x200/filters:fixed_height(100,100):origin()/pre00/2d0c/th/pre/f/2009/252/4/a/bac_tsr_2_by_bagera3005.png" height="200" width="205"/>            <media:content url="https://pre00.deviantart.net/2d0c/th/pre/f/2009/252/4/a/bac_tsr_2_by_bagera3005.png" height="884" width="904" medium="image"/>

The TSR-2 was designed to penetrate a well-defended forward battle area at low altitudes and very high speeds, and then attack high-value targets in the rear with close-in bomb runs and precision drops. The TSR-2 included a number of advanced features that made it the highest performing aircraft in this role, yet the programme was controversially cancelled in favour of the General Dynamics F-111, a procurement that itself was later cancelled.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#147; All modern aircraft have four dimensions: span, length, height and politics. TSR-2 simply got the first three right. &amp;#148;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#151; Sir Sydney Camm&lt;br /&gt;Contents&lt;br /&gt;[hide]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* 1 Development&lt;br /&gt;o 1.1 Background&lt;br /&gt;o 1.2 GOR 339&lt;br /&gt;o 1.3 Political changes&lt;br /&gt;o 1.4 Submissions&lt;br /&gt;o 1.5 The mission&lt;br /&gt;* 2 Design&lt;br /&gt;* 3 Operational history&lt;br /&gt;o 3.1 Testing&lt;br /&gt;o 3.2 Project cancellation&lt;br /&gt;* 4 Survivors&lt;br /&gt;* 5 Specifications&lt;br /&gt;* 6 See also&lt;br /&gt;* 7 References&lt;br /&gt;o 7.1 Notes&lt;br /&gt;o 7.2 Bibliography&lt;br /&gt;* 8 External links&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Background&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to the TSR-2 effort, the British Royal Air Force had deployed the English Electric Canberra bomber, capable of flying at high altitudes and relatively high speeds. Like the de Havilland Mosquito before it, the Canberra carried no defensive weapons and relied on its high performance to allow it to avoid defenses. Fighters could approach the speeds of the Canberra, but doing so while climbing to its altitude was by no means a trivial task. Nevertheless, as the performance of the Soviet interceptors grew, the Canberra grew increasingly vulnerable. English Electric had been studying higher performance designs, otherwise similar to the Canberra, since even before the Canberra entered service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The introduction of the radar-guided surface-to-air missile (SAM) significantly upset this balance. SAMs attacked in a straight line from below, and had speed and altitude performance much greater than any contemporary aircraft. The Canberra, and other high-altitude aircraft like the Avro Vulcan or B-52 Stratofortress, were extremely vulnerable to these weapons. The solution was to fly lower. Since radar operates in line-of-sight, an aircraft flying at 200 ft (60 m) only becomes visible at about 25 miles (40 km) distance. An aircraft traveling just under Mach 1, say Mach 0.85 or 650 mph (1046 km/h), will cover this distance in a little over two minutes, giving the SAM site very little time to prepare for an attack. This also assumes a perfectly smooth Earth; trees, hills, valleys and any other obstructions reduce this range even more, making an attack extremely difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Canberra was designed for high-altitude flight and could not be easily flown at lower altitudes. In particular its large wings would result in high loads due to turbulence. Additionally, navigation at low altitudes is a demanding task, one that the 1940s era electronics of the Canberra was simply not up to. Low-level strike fighters, or &quot;interdictors&quot; as they became known, grew into a new class of their own through the late 1950s. They generally featured high wing loading to reduce the effects of turbulence, some form of high performance navigational radar to allow them to fly very low at high speeds, and large fuel loads to offset the higher fuel use at low altitudes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOR 339&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aware of these issues, the Ministry of Supply started work with English Electric in 1956, attempting to define a new interdictor. Originally the designs concentrated on a smaller aircraft more similar to a fighter, and there was some discussion of developing the P.1B project (soon to become the English Electric Lightning) in this direction as the P.18, while adaptations of the earlier developments of the Canberra were gathered under the P.17 designation. These early studies eventually settled on an aircraft with a 2,000 nm (3,700 km) ferry range, Mach 1.5 speed &quot;at altitude&quot;, and VTOL or STOL performance. The latter requirement was a side-effect of common battle plans from the 1950s, which suggested that nuclear strikes in the opening stages of war would damage most runways and airbases, meaning that aircraft would need to take off from improvised sites, or even fields. As the project continued, the requirements continued to grow. A crew of two was required, one operating the advanced navigational and attack equipment, and bombload was six 1,000 lb (450 kg) bombs. This basically eliminated the P.18 design as a suitable approach, and further work concentrated solely on the delta-wing P.17A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The requirements were eventually made official in March 1957 with GOR (General Operational Requirement) 339. This specification was exceptionally ambitious for the technology of the day, requiring a supersonic all-weather aircraft that could deliver nuclear weapons over a long range, operate at high level at Mach 2+ or low level at Mach 1.2, with a short takeoff ability from rough and ready airstrips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specifically the requirement included:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* deliver tactical nuclear weapons at low level in all weathers.&lt;br /&gt;* photo-reconnaissance at medium and low levels day and night&lt;br /&gt;* electronic reconnaissance&lt;br /&gt;* deliver tactical nuclear weapons day and night at medium altitudes blind bombing if necessary&lt;br /&gt;* deliver conventional bombs and rockets&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low level was stated to be under 1,000 ft (300 m) with an expected attack speed at sea-level of Mach 0.95. The operational range was to be 1,000 nautical miles (1,850 km) operating off runways of no more than 3,000 ft (900 m).[1]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Political changes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this specification was being studied by various manufacturers, the first of the political storms that were to dog the project reared its head, when Defence Minister Duncan Sandys stated in the 1957 Defence White Paper the era of manned combat was at an end and ballistic missiles were the weapons of the future. Within a decade, this philosophy became thoroughly discredited, but at the time, and in the climate of the Cold War and &quot;mutual deterrence&quot;, it doubtless appeared to make some sense, especially as it seemed missiles would offer significant cost savings over manned aircraft. Debate over the need for GOR 339 in light of the White Paper continued for some time, but it was eventually allowed to continue as one of the projects that was &quot;too far along&quot; to cancel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with this was the uncertainty caused by the House of Commons Select Committee on Estimates&amp;#039; report of the year prior. This report suggested that contracts should only be accepted from teams consisting of more than one company, in order to force the companies to merge. Although the large number of companies in the UK at the time was a problem, the Committee&amp;#039;s solution to the problem led to various problems when teams that had never even spoken before were forced to work together for no reason other than to have a chance of winning work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another political matter that did not help was the mutual distrust between the various services. At the time GOR 339 was being defined the Royal Navy was in the midst of their NA.39 project, which would eventually become the Blackburn Buccaneer. The Buc was also a low-altitude high-speed attack aircraft, but designed for overwater contrary to overland use. The savings involved in both forces using a common aircraft would be considerable, and Blackburn offered the RAF a supersonic version of the NA.39 to fit the GOR 339 requirements. However, the RAF rebuffed the proposal, stating that anything under Mach 2 performance was unsatisfactory, and S/VTOL performance was mandatory. As one RAF official put it, &quot;If we show the slightest interest in NA.39 we might not get the GOR.339 aircraft.&quot;[2]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Submissions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Work on GOR 339 continued, with a deadline for submissions on 31 January 1958. A large number of proposals were entered; EE&amp;#039;s P.17A along with designs from Avro, Hawker and Vickers-Armstrong (through their Supermarine division). Short Brothers also sent in the P.17D, a flying platform that was to be used in concert with the P.17A, lifting it into the air so that the P.17 did not have to have VTOL performance on its own. The Air Ministry eventually selected the EE P.17A and the Supermarine 571 for further development. The Ministry was particularly impressed with the Vickers submission, which included not only the aircraft design, but a &quot;total systems concept&quot; which outlined all the support facilities and logistics needed to support the aircraft in the field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOR 339 was revealed to the public in December 1958 in a statement to the House of Commons. Under pressure by the recommendations of the Committee on Estimates, the Air Ministry examined ways that the various project proposals could be combined, and in January 1959 the Minister of Supply announced that the TSR-2 would be built by Vickers-Armstrong working with English Electric; the initials coming from &quot;Tactical Strike and Reconnaissance 2&quot;.[1]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On 1 January 1959 the project was given an official go-ahead under the new designation OR (Operational Requirement) 343. OR 343 was more specific and built upon work from the various submissions to GOR 339 specifically stating that the low level operations would be at 200 ft or less, and that Mach 2 should be attained at altitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The mission&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The envisioned &quot;standard mission&quot; for the TSR-2 was to carry a 2,000 lb (900 kg) weapon internally for a combat radius of 1,000 nautical miles (nm) (1,850 km). Of that mission 100 nm (185 km) was to be flown at higher altitudes at Mach 1.7 and the 200 nm (370 km) into and out of the target area was to be flown as low as 200 feet (60 m) at Mach 0.95. The rest of the mission was to be flown at Mach 0.92. If the entire mission were to be flown at the low 200-ft altitude, the mission radius was reduced to 700 nm (1,300 km). Heavier weapons loads could be carried with further reductions in range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extensions to the TSR-2&amp;#039;s range were planned to be made by fitting external tanks &amp;#151; one 450-Imperial gallon (2,000 L) tank under each wing or one 1,000 Imperial gallon (4,500 L) tank carried centrally below the fuselage. If no internal weapons were carried, a further 570 Imperial gallons (2,600 L) could be carried in a tank in the weapons bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was also planned to be able to equip the TSR-2 with a reconnaissance pack in the weapons bay which, coupled to the aircraft&amp;#039;s capable sideways looking radar (SLAR), would have turned the aircraft into a formidable &quot;recon&quot; asset not unlike the contemporary North American RA-5C of the United States Navy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;English Electric, manufacturer of the Canberra, and Vickers-Armstrongs had been judged to have made the best submissions for GOR 339. The two companies combined their ideas for the specification and put forward their joint design with a view to an aircraft flying by 1963. No order was forthcoming and by the time the Ministry had made a decision the various companies had been amalgamated as the British Aircraft Corporation in 1960. EE had put forward a delta winged design and Vickers a swept wing on a long fuselage. The EE wing, born of their greater supersonic experience, was judged superior to Vickers, while the Vickers fuselage was preferred. In effect, the aircraft would be built 50/50: Vickers the front half, EE the back.[1]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design was a large aircraft to be powered by two Bristol-Siddeley Olympus afterburning turbojets, with a large shoulder-mounted slab-wing with down-turned tips, an all-moving swept tailplane and a large all-moving fin. The engines were a variant of those used in the Avro Vulcan, and would later be developed further for Concorde. It is often stated, incorrectly, that the leading designer of the TSR-2 was Vickers&amp;#039; Barnes Wallis, the legendary aeronautical engineer famous for his Wellington bomber design and contribution to the Dambusters raids. Wallis was not involved in the TSR-2, but his son, who also worked for Vickers, was involved with it to a small extent. In fact Wallis was quite critical of the TSR-2, and stated that a &quot;swing-wing&quot; design (a concept that he championed, having done much work on it) would be more appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design featured blown flaps to achieve the short takeoff and landing requirement, something that later designs would achieve with the technically more complex swing-wing approach. The aircraft featured some extremely sophisticated avionics for navigation and mission delivery &amp;#151; far ahead of anything else available at the time &amp;#151; which would also prove to be one of the reasons for the spiraling costs of the project. Some features, such as ground-following terrain radar, FLIR cameras, side-looking airborne radar and the sophisticated autopilot, only became commonplace on military aircraft later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wing loading was high for its time, enabling the aircraft to fly at very high speed and low level with great stability without being constantly upset by thermals and other ground-related weather phenomena. This in turn made the innovative ground-following radar and autopilot system feasible. To improve the ride quality at low levels further, the cockpit had a degree of &quot;float&quot; to help damp out turbulence and reduce crew fatigue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were considerable problems with realizing the design. Some contributing manufacturers were employed directly by the Ministry rather than through BAC, and the Ministry itself took on design tasks, with the usual long deliberations and meetings typical of civil servants.[3]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Operational history&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Testing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the increasing costs (which were inevitable, given the low original estimates), two prototype aircraft were completed. Test pilot Roland Beamont made the first flight on 27 September 1964. In the course of testing, the TSR-2 was found to meet easily the demanding GOR 339 performance specification. Aerodynamically the aircraft was trouble-free, but there were continual problems with the engines and the undercarriage. Indeed, the engines delivered for the first aircraft did not fit, leading to delays for the first flight which meant that the TSR-2 missed the opportunity to be displayed to the public at that year&amp;#039;s Farnborough Air Show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial flight tests were all performed with the undercarriage down and engine power strictly limited. Only on the tenth test flight was the landing gear successfully retracted, but vibration problems on landing persisted. The aircraft&amp;#039;s nosegear vibrated at the resonance frequency of the eyeball, causing the pilot and navigator to suffer double vision during taxiing. The problem was dealt with by adding damping into the already extremely complex landing gear. The second prototype (XR220) incorporated additional dampers in the main gear legs (fixed dampers having been flight tested on XR219).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first supersonic test flight (Flight 14), was achieved on the transfer from the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at Boscombe Down to BAC Warton. Surprisingly, the aircraft achieved Mach 1 on dry power only (supercruise). Following this, test pilot Beamont lit one of the afterburners only (because of problems with the other engine&amp;#039;s afterburner fuel pump), with the result that the aircraft accelerated away from the chase Lightning despite its engaging full afterburner on both engines.[3]A speed of Mach 1.2 was reached on that occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a period of six months many test flights were conducted. None of the complex electronics were fitted to the first prototype, so these flights were all concerned with the basic flying qualities of the aircraft, which according to the test pilot involved, were outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Project cancellation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The United States had developed the swing-wing General Dynamics F-111 project as a follow-on to the F-105 Thunderchief, a fast low-level bomber designed in the 1950s with an internal bay for a nuclear weapon. As a cost-saving measure over developing a duplicate aircraft, the RAF considered the F-111 as an alternative. In response to suggestions of cancellation BAC employees held a protest march, and the new Labour government, which came to power in 1964, issued strong denials. But in the budget speech of 6 April 1965, the cancellation in favour of the F-111 was announced. A week later the Chancellor defended the decision in a debate in the House of Commons, saying that the F-111 would prove cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;One of the surviving airframes at the RAF Museum, Cosford&lt;br /&gt;One of the surviving airframes at the RAF Museum, Cosford&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TSR-2 tooling and partially completed aircraft were scrapped. Two finished but unflown aircraft eventually survived, though with substantial internal damage inflicted; XR220 at the RAF Museum, Cosford near Wolverhampton, and XR222 at the Imperial War Museum Duxford. A number of unfinished airframes were hastily scrapped, with very few parts retained intact. Along with two unfinished frames (XR221 and XR223), the only airframe ever to fly, XR219, was taken to Shoeburyness and used as a target to test the vulnerability of a modern airframe and systems to gunfire.[3] The haste with which the project was scrapped has been the source of much argument and bitterness since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To replace the TSR-2 the Ministry decided on two aircraft, one would be the swing-wing American General Dynamics F-111K for the strike reconnaissance role with a longer-term replacement being a joint Anglo-French project for a variable geometry strike aircraft, dubbed AFVG.[1] However, the F-111K itself suffered enormous cost escalation, far exceeding that of the TSR-2 projection, and many technical problems before its successful deployment in combat. Coupled with a poorer than projected performance and the devaluation of the pound, the order for 50 F-111Ks for the RAF was cancelled and instead they took on the F-4 Phantom II and the Blackburn Buccaneer, some of which were transferred from the Royal Navy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were the very same aircraft that the RAF had apparently derided in order to get the TSR-2 go-ahead, but the Buccaneer proved capable and was still in service into the early 1990s. The TSR-2 nonetheless remains a lingering &quot;what if?&quot; of British aviation, like the CF-105 Arrow interceptor in Canada. The Phantom and Buccaneer were eventually replaced by the variable-geometry Panavia Tornado, a much smaller design than either the F-111 or the TSR-2. Experience in the design and development of the avionics, particularly the terrain-following capabilities, were used on the later Tornado programme. The Soviet Union also developed swing-wing fighters and strike bombers in the late 1960s and 1970s. The Royal Australian Air Force adopted the F-111, and continues to fly them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A government study into the feasibility of resurrecting the TSR-2 project was carried out during the early 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister.[citation needed] There was, briefly, some speculation that TSR-2 might yet see the light of day in an updated form.[citation needed] But after the study concluded that it would be far too expensive (the previous destruction requiring a complete start from scratch), and that the technology was no longer cutting edge, the TSR-2 was cancelled forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[edit] Survivors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* XR220 (X-02) is on display at the RAF Museum Cosford, England.&lt;br /&gt;* XR222 (X-04) is on display at the Imperial War Museum Duxford, England.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Specifications&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General characteristics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Crew: 2&lt;br /&gt;* Length: 89 ft &amp;#189; in (27.12 m)&lt;br /&gt;* Wingspan: 37 ft 1&amp;#190; in (11.27 m)&lt;br /&gt;* Height: 23 ft 9 in (7.24 m)&lt;br /&gt;* Wing area: 702.9 ft&amp;#178; (65.3 m&amp;#178;&lt;img src=&quot;https://e.deviantart.net/emoticons/w/wink.gif&quot; width=&quot;15&quot; height=&quot;15&quot; alt=&quot;;)&quot; title=&quot;;) (Wink)&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Empty weight: 54,750 lb (24,834 kg)&lt;br /&gt;* Loaded weight: 79,573 lb (36,169 kg)&lt;br /&gt;* Max takeoff weight: 102,200 lb (46,357 kg)&lt;br /&gt;* Powerplant: 2&amp;#215; Bristol-Siddeley Olympus BOl.22R (Mk. 320) turbojet&lt;br /&gt;o Dry thrust: 19,610 lb (87.23 kN) each&lt;br /&gt;o Thrust with afterburner: 30,610 lbf (136.7 kN) each&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Maximum speed: Mach 2.15&lt;br /&gt;* Range: 1,150 (1,850 km)&lt;br /&gt;* Service ceiling 54,000 ft (16,459 m)&lt;br /&gt;* Rate of climb: 50,000 ft/min[citation needed] (16,000 m/min)&lt;br /&gt;* Thrust/weight: 0.77&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armament&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Internal weapons bay, 20 ft (6 m) with 1 Red Beard (nuclear) or 6 x 1,000 lb (450 kg) HE bombs,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* or 4 x 37 rocket packs or nuclear weaponry on inner pylons only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maximum of 20,000 lbs (9,000 kg) of bombs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avionics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Autonetics Verdan autopilot modified by Elliot Automation&lt;br /&gt;* Ferranti (terrain following radar and navigation/attack systems)&lt;br /&gt;* EMI (sideways looking radar)&lt;br /&gt;* Marconi (general avionics)&lt;br /&gt;* Cossor (IFF)&lt;br /&gt;* Plessey (Radio)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://t00.deviantart.net/lEZ885NkFbICdF40hJkgNLReawA=/300x200/filters:fixed_height(100,100):origin()/pre00/2d0c/th/pre/f/2009/252/4/a/bac_tsr_2_by_bagera3005.png&quot; alt=&quot;thumbnail&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>            </item>

BACKGROUND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The United States and the United Kingdom joined forces with the Soviet Union to end World War II with the knowledge that they potentially may have to prepare for a post-war confrontation with the USSR.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Soviet leader Joseph Stalin&#039;s post-war ambitions were no secret: Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan, along with the countries they had conquered, would be liberated by Communism, and Stalin himself would lead the way. The West wasn&#039;t about to tolerate Stalin&#039;s vision, especially since bringing revolution to their borders was part of his long-term plan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Soviet Union could have eastern Europe and its portion of Nazi Germany and no more, in the view of the West. Stalin disagreed and nearly went to war with the West in 1948 over Berlin. In 1951 he threatened a full invasion of western Europe and use of his nation&#039;s nuclear weapons. Tensions were eased after a coup led by two of Stalin&#039;s closest associates, Laverntiy Beria and Georgy Malenkov, deposed Stalin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Beria&#039;s moves to liberalize the Soviet economy and open relations with the West backfired. In 1953 he was deposed himself, charged with treason; terrorism (during World War II); counter-revolutionary activities; and dozens of sexual assaults on women. Beria&#039;s replacement, former KGB head Ivan Serov, reversed Beria&#039;s policies and turned the USSR into a police state while increasing both its military and its nuclear arsenal. Under Serov, the USSR supported Communist insurgencies in Cuba, Angola and Vietnam and ensured cooperative governments among the nations in its sphere of influence (including Yugoslavia, which joined the Pact in 1958 after Marshal Tito died in a mysterious train accident).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The West would not allow Serov&#039;s aggressiveness to go unchallenged, especially after the death of American pilot Gary Powers, shot down during a U.S. Air Force spy mission in 1960. A year later, the Cuban Missile Crisis put East and West on the brink of war. When Serov became convinced the Soviets would handily lose in a nuclear exchange with the West -- the Allies still had a 4-1 advantage in nukes -- the crisis de-escalated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;America and her British and French allies had quietly built up their own nuclear arsenal since the Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Kyoto bombs drove Japan to surrender in 1945. American, British and French foreign policy mandated they oppose Soviet aggression anywhere in the world and beyond; that led not just to the race to establish a presence in orbit and the moon, but also to covert and overt funding of anti-Soviet forces in countries the USSR had targeted for &quot;liberation&quot;. U.S. domestic policy led to the banning of the American Communist Party and of extreme crackdowns on anti-government and anti-military movements on university campuses in the &#039;60s and &#039;70s (President Carter and a Democrat-controlled Congress undid many of the laws allowing for such drastic measures in 1978; the Patriot Act of 2002 restored them in the event of war).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 1970s, however, saw a series of diplomatic and military defeats by the West that set the stage for future regional and global conflicts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;1970 saw the establishment of the African Confederation of Nations, obstensibly neutral, with some members eagerly participating and others &quot;recently liberated from aggressive Western powers&quot;; by the mid-1980s, the Confederation considered itself a &quot;dear friend of the workers and peasants of the world&quot;. Centered in Angola, the 19-nation confederation was complicit in the series of assassinations that led to Israel&#039;s diplomatic split from the U.S. in 1979. With American withdrawal from Vietnam in 1976 and British/South African withdrawal from Rhodesia in 1978, the Soviets stepped in and entrenched themselves, doing the same in Cambodia (1977) and Nicaragua (1979). In 1982, Israel and Soviet ally Egypt signed a 50-year peace treaty in Moscow, and a year later coups in Yemen and Oman led to the establishment of the Arabian People&#039;s Republic. The establishment of the World Pact in 1984 between the USSR and its various allies put the West on edge; the Soviets&#039; actions in 1986 put the world teetering on the edge of Armageddon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;In late September, pro-Moscow governments were installed in 15 nations including Venezuela; Iran; Thailand; Guatemala; and Nepal. On October 4, India declared itself neutral, while sending aid to pro-Moscow governments across the world. Soviet military buildups began that day worldwide from the Persian Gulf to the Caribbean to the border between East and West Germany. Soviet leader Grigory Romanov decried &quot;American aggression&quot; in an October 22 radio address, which was followed by the detonation of a 100-megaton nuclear bomb in Siberia. The USSR&#039;s first naval supercarrier, the Leningrad, made port at the P.A.R. naval base outside Aden hours later.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;After tensions along the Korean demilitarized zone and the Austrian-Chechoslovakian border nearly led to armed conflict, United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar called for an emergency meeting October 22. China seconded Cuellar&#039;s call for a peaceful resolution of the conflict and offered its capital Beijing as a site for a summit between Romanov and U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Instead -- at Moscow&#039;s insistence -- every Soviet-allied nation withdrew from the U.N. that afternoon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, five Yugoslavian delegates remained, and declared themselves as representative of the &quot;free peoples of Bosnia, Croatia, Herzegovina, Macedonia and Slovenia&quot;. Within the hour armed uprisings had began in those Yugoslavian socialist republics, and also in Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo. Moscow&#039;s response was intensive conventional bombing of the entire country plus an ultimatum to Reagan and U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that was immediately rejected.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The list of demands signed by Romanov included Allied withdrawal from Germany, South Korea and complete U.S. withdrawal from Guatanamo Bay in Cuba, Subic Bay in the Philippines, Okinawa in Japan and the Panama Canal Zone. The Allies were also to allow for &quot;complete African and Middle Eastern neutrality...shared usage of Saudi Arabian oil fields...and a 25 percent reduction in strategic nuclear weapons within 12 months&quot;. The Soviets, in turn, offered to not build bombs of 25 megatons and more and joint jurisdiction of a future moon base with the U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The offer was said to have been turned down by Reagan on Air Force One as it landed at Joint Base Knox in Kentucky. He then took a phone call from Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, offering his nation&#039;s assistance to the West &quot;against Soviet aggression&quot;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Washington, London and the rest of the world prepared for war.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;On October 26, the U.S. detonated a 100-megaton bomb (&quot;Fat Albert&quot;) two-and-a-half miles above the Arctic Ocean. Simultaneously the British detonated a 100-megaton device over the Pitcairn Islands, its last Pacific Ocean-based territory. And China detonated its own 100 MT weapon over sparsely-populated Xinjiang Province. The triple explosions were followed by the unveiling of America&#039;s sub-orbital missile defense system, the product of 35 years of research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;That got Moscow&#039;s attention, but Romanov and much of the core group around him were not deterred; to them, conflict with the West was not only inevitable but winnable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mikhail Gorbachev, one of Romanov&#039;s core advisors, had a very different point of view.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;With the help of sympathizers in the Kremlin, the military and the KGB, Gorbachev saw for himself Romanov dragged out of his office. Gorbachev walked inside and, upon getting confirmation from co-conspirators that all important military, government and intelligence centers were secured, ordered an emergency meeting of the Politburo. With himself and two other members in the room and the others under arrest, Gorbachev was selected General Secretary. He then contacted Reagan, informed him of the coup, and offered to pull his forces &quot;back into sanity&quot;. Reagan and Gorbachev agreed on terms; Gorbachev explained November 1 in a TV and radio address that &quot;because the Soviet Union brought us all to the edge of annihilation, it is incumbent upon the Soviet Union to show the rest of the world it is serious about seeking peace&quot;. All World Pact members followed Gorbachev&#039;s lead, despite their own misgivings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yugoslavia&#039;s eight nations were allowed to begin a five-year transition to independence upon confirmation by popular vote: Kosovo, Serbia and Macedonia governments, riding on the coattails of Gorbachev&#039;s immense popularity, chose to remain in the Soviet bloc. The other five republics chose complete independence. Gorbachev also denounced &quot;the forces of evil&quot; that, along with bringing the world to the brink of extinction, &quot;had overthrown the peaceful, lawfully-established governments of Venezuela, Israel, Egypt and Yemen&quot;. The leaders of the governments-in-exile -- all hosted within the U.S. -- returned to their homelands to rebuild their Western-friendly countries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gorbachev also encouraged the &quot;evolution&quot; of the African Confederation into the African Community of Nations, and assented to the dismantling of the hegemony&#039;s limited nuclear arsenal. Oman, the remaining nation of the Arabian People&#039;s Republic, also had its nuclear weapons removed. In return, Israel and South Africa were to officially be free of nuclear weapons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;By 1988 Gorbachev&#039;s policies of perestroika and glasnost had been implemented within the USSR and many of its allied nations. He talked openly of joint, peaceful interactions between Communist and capitalist nations and became the first Soviet leader to visit New York, Washington, London, Paris, Bonn, Beijing and Tokyo. His visit to West Berlin gave hope to those who wanted the Berlin Wall torn down and free movement allowed once more between both halves of the city. He spoke of joint exploration of the solar system with the Americans and Chinese.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Behind the scenes, however, political opposition slowly built and, in 1991, Radio Moscow announced the death of Gorbachev and the ascension of his replacement, hard-liner Gennady Yanayev. Almost overnight, the Berlin Wall -- which had come down four months earlier -- arose again, initially as a line of barbed-wire and trigger-happy East German guards, by year&#039;s end as a literal wall with East German guards patrolling on top, separated every four meters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yanayev&#039;s first actions were to send Soviet military into the former Yugoslavia, which had been split into eight separate republics with Gorbachev&#039;s approval. While the Soviets were able to hold Serbia, Kosovo and Macedonia, the presence of NATO troops in the other five&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Balkan&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;republics prevented Moscow from reunifying the Balkan nations. While the other five republics strengthened ties with the West, the three Communist republics joined the Warsaw Pact. In 1997, the USSR announced it had willingly accepted invitations from the member countries of the recently-established Hanoi, Havana and Luanda Pacts. The West responded with the expansion of the NATO and ANZUS treaties plus the establishment of Western-friendly alliances in the Americas, the Middle East and Africa, and Asia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;By 2002, Syria and Iran were in the Warsaw Pact. The Havana Pact established a foothold in central America, threatening Belize, Costa Rica and Panama. The Hanoi Pact ruled over much of southeast Asia. The Luanda Pact -- which professed itself to be the ideological successor to the African Confederation -- threatened not just the Western-friendly governments of South Africa and the Boer Republic but the neutrally-aligned regional powers, including Kenya and Nigeria.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Largely to dispel international tensions and stave off potential Soviet incursions, a sizeable group of countries make up the Non-Aligned Movement. Each associated nation is neutral in the dispute between East and West, and their neutrality is backed by the military and economic power of China. Since the Sino-Soviet split in the 1960s and China&#039;s last-minute support of the U.S. in 1986, the Chinese had thrown its support behind the neutral countries, strengthening India&#039;s position in Asia (and replacing the USSR as its primary trading partner), &quot;Free Africa&quot;&#039;s economic standing and Saudi Arabia&#039;s ability to freely sell oil to all comers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a result, China is seen almost as another Western power by those in charge in Moscow. Vladimir Putin was the last Soviet leader to advocate closer ties with China, and was likely deposed for it. The current General Secretary, Red Army Marshal Mikhail Khalinin, sees the Chinese to be as much of a threat as the Americans. Under Putin and his predecessors, Khalinin oversaw the rebuilding of the Soviet military into a force that could fight, and win, a global, multi-front conventional war.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2008, the Soviet Union has built up its forces in several key areas -- Cuba, Nicaragua and Honduras and off the coasts of Columbia and Venezuela; within and offshore of Omani territory, as well as within Syria and Iran; within easy striking distance of northern, western and southern Africa; along the Hanoi Pact nations&#039; borders with China; in the north Pacific near Japan and Alaska; and near the West German, Austrian, Croatian and Turkish borders in Europe. Khalinin would not have signed off on this unless he and his compatriots were confident that the Soviet military and those of her allies together were now the better of the Western nations and of the Chinese. The Red Rain orbital missile system, hiding in plain sight as oversized telecommunications satellites, went online in 2007 and, say its designers, negates the West&#039;s Star Wars system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The West, in turn, has continued to build up its military since Gorbachev&#039;s death. There&#039;s at least one Western ship, troop, tank and plane for every Communist ship, troop, tank and plane near Western territory. If the Communists can fight and win a global war, so can the Allies (even without China&#039;s help). And both sides have an equal number of nuclear weapons, including the 100-megaton &quot;province killers&quot;. Then there&#039;s China&#039;s smaller, but significant arsenal, as well as the nukes unofficially kept by the Israelis, Boers, South Africans, North and South Koreans, Saudis, Cubans, Croats, and 23 other countries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The USSR is confident it can win the war should it go nuclear, but many within the Kremlin and military privately acknowledge an all-out exchange would spell the end of civilization. While there is said to be a city-sized complex somewhere in Siberia as a safe zone for Soviet officials, Britain and France are resigned to complete destruction. China is said to have a retreat complex somewhere in its mountains. The U.S. is rumored to have &quot;doomsday vaults&quot; in the Rocky Mountains, upstate New York, the caves of Kentucky and even under the New America theme park/entertainment complex in southern Illinois.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;While conventional forces prepare for conflict, the Soviets and the Allies are meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, in one last attempt to resolve their differences. The Allies, particularly the British, are all but convinced Khalinin wants war, not to be destroyed but to, at the least, force a ceasefire with terms very agreeable to his side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many people around the world, expect that conventional fighting will not spill over into all-out atomic war because the effects of such a war itself serves as a deterrent to the rational person. What they don&#039;t know is the confidence among leaders on both sides of surviving such a war -- and why.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 1999, farmers in Soviet Georgia, and a hunter in U.S. Wyoming, came across what can best be described as a local wormhole. Government and military investigators soon discovered one could step through the circular phenomenon into a parallel universe. Similar wormholes appeared in China, and scientists in all three countries discovered how to safely replicate the phenomena and control it. In a top-secret, high-level summit in Beijing, Chinese Premier Li convinced President Powell and General Secretary Putin to use the technology for peaceful purposes -- or, at least, to allow for the survival of some people in the event of a total atomic exchange. The existence of the wormholes, the technology that opens them, and the parallel realities on the other side of them are known only to top government and military officials and certain economic and business leaders in all major countries. Disclosure to the general public is punishable by anywhere from life imprisonment to the death penalty, although word is beginning to leak out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;No one hopes things will get to the point where an all-out nuclear exchange is necessary (as are the use of the wormholes). Everyone is preparing as if it will.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;II. FACTIONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;The so-called Allied Powers have never been formalized as such. Rather, they are recognized as the member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO); the North, Central and South American and Free Caribbean Treaty Organization (ACTO); the Southeast Asian Trade Organization (SEATO); the Middle Eastern and African Trade Alliance (MEATA); and the Australian-New Zealand-United States Treaty Organization (ANZUS).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The chief countries of the Allied Powers -- and by extension the free world -- are clearly defined.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;On 19 August 1995 after the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Balkan&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;War, the leaders of Australia; France; Great Britain; Italy; Japan; the United States; and West Germany met in Brussels, Belgium to plan a quick, organized and decisive political response to increased geopolitical and military actions by the Soviet Union. Despite attempts by Moscow to have United Nations sanctions imposed on the seven nations, the roadmap to the establishment of the five multi-national alliances was set in stone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;All seven nations are members of each of the five alliances (mirroring the USSR&#039;s membership within the Hanoi, Havana, Luanda and Warsaw Pacts). The alliances nominally are regionally-based associations providing for mutual free trade and military defense by their members. It should be noted, however, that the &quot;Free Seven&quot; nations have the ultimate say, particularly in regards to military actions and economic sanctions...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br

            <description>Another commission, this time from &lt;span class=&quot;username-with-symbol u&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;u regular username&quot; href=&quot;https://briwd.deviantart.com&quot;&gt;briwd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;user-symbol regular&quot; data-quicktip-text=&quot;&quot; data-show-tooltip=&quot;&quot; data-gruser-type=&quot;regular&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. If you&#039;re interested in your own commission,&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;see&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rvbomally.deviantart.com/journal/Commissions-637115356&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;and send me a message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I. BACKGROUND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The United States and the United Kingdom joined forces with the Soviet Union to end World War II with the knowledge that they potentially may have to prepare for a post-war confrontation with the USSR.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Soviet leader Joseph Stalin&#039;s post-war ambitions were no secret: Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan, along with the countries they had conquered, would be liberated by Communism, and Stalin himself would lead the way. The West wasn&#039;t about to tolerate Stalin&#039;s vision, especially since bringing revolution to their borders was part of his long-term plan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Soviet Union could have eastern Europe and its portion of Nazi Germany and no more, in the view of the West. Stalin disagreed and nearly went to war with the West in 1948 over Berlin. In 1951 he threatened a full invasion of western Europe and use of his nation&#039;s nuclear weapons. Tensions were eased after a coup led by two of Stalin&#039;s closest associates, Laverntiy Beria and Georgy Malenkov, deposed Stalin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Beria&#039;s moves to liberalize the Soviet economy and open relations with the West backfired. In 1953 he was deposed himself, charged with treason; terrorism (during World War II); counter-revolutionary activities; and dozens of sexual assaults on women. Beria&#039;s replacement, former KGB head Ivan Serov, reversed Beria&#039;s policies and turned the USSR into a police state while increasing both its military and its nuclear arsenal. Under Serov, the USSR supported Communist insurgencies in Cuba, Angola and Vietnam and ensured cooperative governments among the nations in its sphere of influence (including Yugoslavia, which joined the Pact in 1958 after Marshal Tito died in a mysterious train accident).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The West would not allow Serov&#039;s aggressiveness to go unchallenged, especially after the death of American pilot Gary Powers, shot down during a U.S. Air Force spy mission in 1960. A year later, the Cuban Missile Crisis put East and West on the brink of war. When Serov became convinced the Soviets would handily lose in a nuclear exchange with the West -- the Allies still had a 4-1 advantage in nukes -- the crisis de-escalated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;America and her British and French allies had quietly built up their own nuclear arsenal since the Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Kyoto bombs drove Japan to surrender in 1945. American, British and French foreign policy mandated they oppose Soviet aggression anywhere in the world and beyond; that led not just to the race to establish a presence in orbit and the moon, but also to covert and overt funding of anti-Soviet forces in countries the USSR had targeted for &quot;liberation&quot;. U.S. domestic policy led to the banning of the American Communist Party and of extreme crackdowns on anti-government and anti-military movements on university campuses in the &#039;60s and &#039;70s (President Carter and a Democrat-controlled Congress undid many of the laws allowing for such drastic measures in 1978; the Patriot Act of 2002 restored them in the event of war).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 1970s, however, saw a series of diplomatic and military defeats by the West that set the stage for future regional and global conflicts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;1970 saw the establishment of the African Confederation of Nations, obstensibly neutral, with some members eagerly participating and others &quot;recently liberated from aggressive Western powers&quot;; by the mid-1980s, the Confederation considered itself a &quot;dear friend of the workers and peasants of the world&quot;. Centered in Angola, the 19-nation confederation was complicit in the series of assassinations that led to Israel&#039;s diplomatic split from the U.S. in 1979. With American withdrawal from Vietnam in 1976 and British/South African withdrawal from Rhodesia in 1978, the Soviets stepped in and entrenched themselves, doing the same in Cambodia (1977) and Nicaragua (1979). In 1982, Israel and Soviet ally Egypt signed a 50-year peace treaty in Moscow, and a year later coups in Yemen and Oman led to the establishment of the Arabian People&#039;s Republic. The establishment of the World Pact in 1984 between the USSR and its various allies put the West on edge; the Soviets&#039; actions in 1986 put the world teetering on the edge of Armageddon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;In late September, pro-Moscow governments were installed in 15 nations including Venezuela; Iran; Thailand; Guatemala; and Nepal. On October 4, India declared itself neutral, while sending aid to pro-Moscow governments across the world. Soviet military buildups began that day worldwide from the Persian Gulf to the Caribbean to the border between East and West Germany. Soviet leader Grigory Romanov decried &quot;American aggression&quot; in an October 22 radio address, which was followed by the detonation of a 100-megaton nuclear bomb in Siberia. The USSR&#039;s first naval supercarrier, the Leningrad, made port at the P.A.R. naval base outside Aden hours later.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;After tensions along the Korean demilitarized zone and the Austrian-Chechoslovakian border nearly led to armed conflict, United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar called for an emergency meeting October 22. China seconded Cuellar&#039;s call for a peaceful resolution of the conflict and offered its capital Beijing as a site for a summit between Romanov and U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Instead -- at Moscow&#039;s insistence -- every Soviet-allied nation withdrew from the U.N. that afternoon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, five Yugoslavian delegates remained, and declared themselves as representative of the &quot;free peoples of Bosnia, Croatia, Herzegovina, Macedonia and Slovenia&quot;. Within the hour armed uprisings had began in those Yugoslavian socialist republics, and also in Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo. Moscow&#039;s response was intensive conventional bombing of the entire country plus an ultimatum to Reagan and U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that was immediately rejected.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The list of demands signed by Romanov included Allied withdrawal from Germany, South Korea and complete U.S. withdrawal from Guatanamo Bay in Cuba, Subic Bay in the Philippines, Okinawa in Japan and the Panama Canal Zone. The Allies were also to allow for &quot;complete African and Middle Eastern neutrality...shared usage of Saudi Arabian oil fields...and a 25 percent reduction in strategic nuclear weapons within 12 months&quot;. The Soviets, in turn, offered to not build bombs of 25 megatons and more and joint jurisdiction of a future moon base with the U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The offer was said to have been turned down by Reagan on Air Force One as it landed at Joint Base Knox in Kentucky. He then took a phone call from Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, offering his nation&#039;s assistance to the West &quot;against Soviet aggression&quot;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Washington, London and the rest of the world prepared for war.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;On October 26, the U.S. detonated a 100-megaton bomb (&quot;Fat Albert&quot;) two-and-a-half miles above the Arctic Ocean. Simultaneously the British detonated a 100-megaton device over the Pitcairn Islands, its last Pacific Ocean-based territory. And China detonated its own 100 MT weapon over sparsely-populated Xinjiang Province. The triple explosions were followed by the unveiling of America&#039;s sub-orbital missile defense system, the product of 35 years of research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;That got Moscow&#039;s attention, but Romanov and much of the core group around him were not deterred; to them, conflict with the West was not only inevitable but winnable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mikhail Gorbachev, one of Romanov&#039;s core advisors, had a very different point of view.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;With the help of sympathizers in the Kremlin, the military and the KGB, Gorbachev saw for himself Romanov dragged out of his office. Gorbachev walked inside and, upon getting confirmation from co-conspirators that all important military, government and intelligence centers were secured, ordered an emergency meeting of the Politburo. With himself and two other members in the room and the others under arrest, Gorbachev was selected General Secretary. He then contacted Reagan, informed him of the coup, and offered to pull his forces &quot;back into sanity&quot;. Reagan and Gorbachev agreed on terms; Gorbachev explained November 1 in a TV and radio address that &quot;because the Soviet Union brought us all to the edge of annihilation, it is incumbent upon the Soviet Union to show the rest of the world it is serious about seeking peace&quot;. All World Pact members followed Gorbachev&#039;s lead, despite their own misgivings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yugoslavia&#039;s eight nations were allowed to begin a five-year transition to independence upon confirmation by popular vote: Kosovo, Serbia and Macedonia governments, riding on the coattails of Gorbachev&#039;s immense popularity, chose to remain in the Soviet bloc. The other five republics chose complete independence. Gorbachev also denounced &quot;the forces of evil&quot; that, along with bringing the world to the brink of extinction, &quot;had overthrown the peaceful, lawfully-established governments of Venezuela, Israel, Egypt and Yemen&quot;. The leaders of the governments-in-exile -- all hosted within the U.S. -- returned to their homelands to rebuild their Western-friendly countries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gorbachev also encouraged the &quot;evolution&quot; of the African Confederation into the African Community of Nations, and assented to the dismantling of the hegemony&#039;s limited nuclear arsenal. Oman, the remaining nation of the Arabian People&#039;s Republic, also had its nuclear weapons removed. In return, Israel and South Africa were to officially be free of nuclear weapons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;By 1988 Gorbachev&#039;s policies of perestroika and glasnost had been implemented within the USSR and many of its allied nations. He talked openly of joint, peaceful interactions between Communist and capitalist nations and became the first Soviet leader to visit New York, Washington, London, Paris, Bonn, Beijing and Tokyo. His visit to West Berlin gave hope to those who wanted the Berlin Wall torn down and free movement allowed once more between both halves of the city. He spoke of joint exploration of the solar system with the Americans and Chinese.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Behind the scenes, however, political opposition slowly built and, in 1991, Radio Moscow announced the death of Gorbachev and the ascension of his replacement, hard-liner Gennady Yanayev. Almost overnight, the Berlin Wall -- which had come down four months earlier -- arose again, initially as a line of barbed-wire and trigger-happy East German guards, by year&#039;s end as a literal wall with East German guards patrolling on top, separated every four meters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yanayev&#039;s first actions were to send Soviet military into the former Yugoslavia, which had been split into eight separate republics with Gorbachev&#039;s approval. While the Soviets were able to hold Serbia, Kosovo and Macedonia, the presence of NATO troops in the other five&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Balkan&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;republics prevented Moscow from reunifying the Balkan nations. While the other five republics strengthened ties with the West, the three Communist republics joined the Warsaw Pact. In 1997, the USSR announced it had willingly accepted invitations from the member countries of the recently-established Hanoi, Havana and Luanda Pacts. The West responded with the expansion of the NATO and ANZUS treaties plus the establishment of Western-friendly alliances in the Americas, the Middle East and Africa, and Asia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;By 2002, Syria and Iran were in the Warsaw Pact. The Havana Pact established a foothold in central America, threatening Belize, Costa Rica and Panama. The Hanoi Pact ruled over much of southeast Asia. The Luanda Pact -- which professed itself to be the ideological successor to the African Confederation -- threatened not just the Western-friendly governments of South Africa and the Boer Republic but the neutrally-aligned regional powers, including Kenya and Nigeria.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Largely to dispel international tensions and stave off potential Soviet incursions, a sizeable group of countries make up the Non-Aligned Movement. Each associated nation is neutral in the dispute between East and West, and their neutrality is backed by the military and economic power of China. Since the Sino-Soviet split in the 1960s and China&#039;s last-minute support of the U.S. in 1986, the Chinese had thrown its support behind the neutral countries, strengthening India&#039;s position in Asia (and replacing the USSR as its primary trading partner), &quot;Free Africa&quot;&#039;s economic standing and Saudi Arabia&#039;s ability to freely sell oil to all comers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a result, China is seen almost as another Western power by those in charge in Moscow. Vladimir Putin was the last Soviet leader to advocate closer ties with China, and was likely deposed for it. The current General Secretary, Red Army Marshal Mikhail Khalinin, sees the Chinese to be as much of a threat as the Americans. Under Putin and his predecessors, Khalinin oversaw the rebuilding of the Soviet military into a force that could fight, and win, a global, multi-front conventional war.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2008, the Soviet Union has built up its forces in several key areas -- Cuba, Nicaragua and Honduras and off the coasts of Columbia and Venezuela; within and offshore of Omani territory, as well as within Syria and Iran; within easy striking distance of northern, western and southern Africa; along the Hanoi Pact nations&#039; borders with China; in the north Pacific near Japan and Alaska; and near the West German, Austrian, Croatian and Turkish borders in Europe. Khalinin would not have signed off on this unless he and his compatriots were confident that the Soviet military and those of her allies together were now the better of the Western nations and of the Chinese. The Red Rain orbital missile system, hiding in plain sight as oversized telecommunications satellites, went online in 2007 and, say its designers, negates the West&#039;s Star Wars system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The West, in turn, has continued to build up its military since Gorbachev&#039;s death. There&#039;s at least one Western ship, troop, tank and plane for every Communist ship, troop, tank and plane near Western territory. If the Communists can fight and win a global war, so can the Allies (even without China&#039;s help). And both sides have an equal number of nuclear weapons, including the 100-megaton &quot;province killers&quot;. Then there&#039;s China&#039;s smaller, but significant arsenal, as well as the nukes unofficially kept by the Israelis, Boers, South Africans, North and South Koreans, Saudis, Cubans, Croats, and 23 other countries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The USSR is confident it can win the war should it go nuclear, but many within the Kremlin and military privately acknowledge an all-out exchange would spell the end of civilization. While there is said to be a city-sized complex somewhere in Siberia as a safe zone for Soviet officials, Britain and France are resigned to complete destruction. China is said to have a retreat complex somewhere in its mountains. The U.S. is rumored to have &quot;doomsday vaults&quot; in the Rocky Mountains, upstate New York, the caves of Kentucky and even under the New America theme park/entertainment complex in southern Illinois.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;While conventional forces prepare for conflict, the Soviets and the Allies are meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, in one last attempt to resolve their differences. The Allies, particularly the British, are all but convinced Khalinin wants war, not to be destroyed but to, at the least, force a ceasefire with terms very agreeable to his side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many people around the world, expect that conventional fighting will not spill over into all-out atomic war because the effects of such a war itself serves as a deterrent to the rational person. What they don&#039;t know is the confidence among leaders on both sides of surviving such a war -- and why.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 1999, farmers in Soviet Georgia, and a hunter in U.S. Wyoming, came across what can best be described as a local wormhole. Government and military investigators soon discovered one could step through the circular phenomenon into a parallel universe. Similar wormholes appeared in China, and scientists in all three countries discovered how to safely replicate the phenomena and control it. In a top-secret, high-level summit in Beijing, Chinese Premier Li convinced President Powell and General Secretary Putin to use the technology for peaceful purposes -- or, at least, to allow for the survival of some people in the event of a total atomic exchange. The existence of the wormholes, the technology that opens them, and the parallel realities on the other side of them are known only to top government and military officials and certain economic and business leaders in all major countries. Disclosure to the general public is punishable by anywhere from life imprisonment to the death penalty, although word is beginning to leak out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;No one hopes things will get to the point where an all-out nuclear exchange is necessary (as are the use of the wormholes). Everyone is preparing as if it will.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;II. FACTIONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;The so-called Allied Powers have never been formalized as such. Rather, they are recognized as the member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO); the North, Central and South American and Free Caribbean Treaty Organization (ACTO); the Southeast Asian Trade Organization (SEATO); the Middle Eastern and African Trade Alliance (MEATA); and the Australian-New Zealand-United States Treaty Organization (ANZUS).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The chief countries of the Allied Powers -- and by extension the free world -- are clearly defined.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;On 19 August 1995 after the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Balkan&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;War, the leaders of Australia; France; Great Britain; Italy; Japan; the United States; and West Germany met in Brussels, Belgium to plan a quick, organized and decisive political response to increased geopolitical and military actions by the Soviet Union. Despite attempts by Moscow to have United Nations sanctions imposed on the seven nations, the roadmap to the establishment of the five multi-national alliances was set in stone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;All seven nations are members of each of the five alliances (mirroring the USSR&#039;s membership within the Hanoi, Havana, Luanda and Warsaw Pacts). The alliances nominally are regionally-based associations providing for mutual free trade and military defense by their members. It should be noted, however, that the &quot;Free Seven&quot; nations have the ultimate say, particularly in regards to military actions and economic sanctions...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br

So because I fell behind making these milestone pictures I did a sort of Halloween picture.&amp;nbsp; We have Bunnicula looking over his newly acquired harem.&amp;nbsp; We have (left to right) Eliza of &lt;i&gt;The Wild Thornberrys,&lt;/i&gt; Lola Bunny of the &lt;i&gt;Looney Tunes Show, &lt;/i&gt;Blythe Baxter of &lt;i&gt;Littlest Pet Shop,&lt;/i&gt; Jenny of &lt;i&gt;Bucky O&#039;Hare and the Toad Wars,&lt;/i&gt; Alice of Disney&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Alice in Wonderland, &lt;/i&gt;Babs Bunny of the &lt;i&gt;Tiny Toons Adventures,&lt;/i&gt; Jessica Rabbit of &lt;i&gt;Who Framed Roger Rabbit?,&amp;nbsp; &lt;/i&gt;Fluttershy of &lt;i&gt;My Little Pony Friendship is Magic: Equestria Girls.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bunnicula&lt;/b&gt; (voiced by Chris Kattan): The titular character of the show, Bunnicula is a vampire rabbit, and was once the pet of Count Dracula. He is very different from the original version of the character who appears in the books. As it was said by Chester, Bunnicula was found in a locked chamber in the cellar of the apartment complex that Mina, Harold, and Chester now live in. Also, he is shown to have a few vampire traits such as hiding from sunlight, sleeping in a casket, flying with bat wings, and draining juice from vegetables with his fangs. It has been seen that he cannot talk except for a few words (although Harold seems to understand him just fine). He cares for Mina a great deal but tends to cause mischief that yields supernatural consequences. Bunnicula sucks juices from vegetables (just like in the book) but different kinds of vegetables cause some kind of reaction in Bunnicula (sugar beets make him hyperactive and speedy, squashes enlarge his feet, onions make him cry powerful jet streams of tears, garlic turns him into a skeleton bunny, chili peppers make him breathe fire, rutabagas give him telekinesis, turnips turn the house upside-down, wasabi makes him spontaneously combust, leeks give him spider legs, eggplants turn him into a huge and hideous three-eyed monster rabbit, etc.). In the books, it was unclear whether or not Bunnicula had vampiric powers although he was somehow able to get in and out of his cage without opening the door. Unlike his Ruby-Spears incarnation, Bunnicula&#039;s ears turn into bat wings to fly. He also speaks very limited English on rare occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elizabeth &#039;Eliza&#039; Thornberry&lt;/b&gt;, is a cute and beautiful 12 year-old tomboy whom, unknown to most, except her older sister, Debbie (as of the movie), gained the ability to speak with animals after an encounter with an African shaman, two years prior to the start of the series at age ten. Despite her cuteness and beauty, Eliza is portrayed as a geek by her extensive zoological knowledge and her glasses, braces and by occasionally standing pigeon-toed. She has freckles and shoulder-length red-orange hair that is usually worn in braided pigtails with two red elastic bands and occasionally a ponytail. She almost always wears a yellow dress, though later in the series she sports other clothes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lola Bunny&lt;/b&gt; is the secondary&amp;nbsp;tritagonist of the Looney Tunes Show franchise.&amp;nbsp; She is Bugs Bunny&#039;s beautiful, bubbly girlfriend. Lola talks a mile-a-minute, can be absent-minded on occasion,&amp;nbsp;and has a way of getting what she wants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lola first appears in the episode Members Only, at the Royal Oaks Glen Oaks Oakwood Oaks Country Club (or the R.O.G.O.O.O.C.C.) where she meets Bugs, while playing tennis when she hits him with multiple tennis balls as she&#039;s practicing her swing. They are both instantly attracted to one another, so they decide to go out for dinner and a movie. However, Bugs quickly finds out on their date that Lola&#039;s high-spirited personality causes her to talk constantly (speaking what&#039;s on her mind at all times), be forgetful or confused about certain facts, and become so absent-minded that she even mistakes the trailers before the movie as the movie itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the date Bugs decides to avoid Lola, having become annoyed and embarrassed by her quirks (going so far as to say their first date was the worst of his life). Lola, on the other hand, found their date to be the best of her life and tries to get a hold of Bugs through constant phone calls and 128 emails, all of which Bugs ignores. Lola then &quot;runs into&quot; Bugs at the dry cleaners, grocery store and gym. Lola startles Bugs at the gym, which causes an accident that results in weights being dropped on Bugs&#039;s neck. He tells Lola he can&#039;t see her anymore, saying he&#039;s not sure if they&#039;re right for each other. Lola, devastated, starts crying uncontrollably until Bugs exclaims he didn&#039;t mean it, and to his dismay and Lola&#039;s excitement, agrees to go out with her again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an attempt to end things, Bugs dresses up as a woman at the R.O.G.O.O.O.C.C. and tries to convince Lola that he&#039;ll end up breaking her heart. When Bugs comes back to Lola without his disguise on, Lola reveals that the only thing she took away from the conversation with the &quot;ugly woman&quot; is that Bugs is a bad boy, making her even more attracted to him. Lola then notices her parents and introduces them to Bugs. Her dad says that Lola has told them so much about him, however Bugs decries that she doesn&#039;t know anything about him.

She has the amazing ability to talk to animals and she befriends the daycamp pets &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;at Littlest Pet Shop. She loves to design clothes and hang out with her friends. Blythe isn&#039;t sure how or why she can suddenly talk to animals, but now that she can, she couldn&#039;t imagine her life any other way! Blythe&#039;s outfit changes in every episode as well as her hair which also changes. Her dad is Roger Baxter &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and her mom apparently died when she was very young.

In&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Penny For Your Laughs&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;she was briefly best friends with the Biskits after she stood up to Vi for them causing them to be BFFs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jenny&lt;/b&gt; &amp;#8211; first mate and pilot, a cat from the planet Aldebaran (not to be confused with the star in the real life universe of the same name) with mysterious magical and psionic powers common to the females of her species. They include telepathy, astral projection, energy blasts, and healing. Because of the sacred precepts of Alderbaran, she keeps these powers secret from the other members of the crew, with the exception of Willy, to whom she serves as a kind of surrogate mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alice&lt;/b&gt; is the protagonist of Disney&#039;s 1951 animated feature film, &lt;i&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Alice is depicted as a daydreamer first and foremost. Prior to arriving in Wonderland, she sat on the bank of a river listening to her sister reading lessons, which she didn&#039;t like, as the book her sister was reading, had no pictures, and claimed, &quot;In my world, the books would be nothing &lt;i&gt;but&lt;/i&gt; pictures!&quot; This gives some idea of Alice&#039;s large imagination. And at first, Wonderland seemed like the perfect place for Alice, as it allowed her to indulge in her imaginings as well as her intense curiosity. However, Alice&#039;s quick temper and pedantic eagerness to show off her knowledge often proved to be bad qualities in Wonderland, and landed her in many precarious situations. Still she&#039;s seen as polite, honest, adventurous, well spoken, lovely and respectful, if not given a reason to be otherwise. She is also very adventurous and curious. She ends up finding that all of Wonderland was only just in her dreams and not real. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Barbara Anne &quot;Babs&quot; Bunny&lt;/b&gt; is a cartoon character from the Warner Brothers animated television series, &lt;i&gt;Tiny Toon Adventures&lt;/i&gt;. She is the main character of the show along with her best friend, Buster. Babs is voiced by Tress MacNeille. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Babs is a female performer, a funny bunny who will do nearly anything for a laugh. She is good at improvisational comedy, and is a comedic impressionist in the vein of Robin Williams. In the &lt;i&gt;Buster Bunny Bunch&lt;/i&gt; episode segment, &lt;i&gt;Born To Be Riled&lt;/i&gt;, her friends become annoyed with her accurate but unflattering impersonations of them and they retaliate by impersonating her in turn. Like Buster, Babs is usually willing to go out of her way for her friends, such as in the &lt;i&gt;Music Day&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp; episode segment, &lt;i&gt;Loon Lake&lt;/i&gt;, when she sabotages a bunch of swan ballet dancer bullies who are trying to thwart Shirley&#039;s ballet debut. She also is capable of quick costume changes, often achieved by simply spinning around in a circle very fast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babs is our new &quot;star;&quot; a cheerful, hyperactive, lovable and irrepressible ham. She&#039;s sassy, but with a distinctly feminine flair. Babs is a high energy impressionist and comedienne who doesn&#039;t know when to quit. Buster&#039;s best friend and co-host, Babs is a one-rabbit entertainment center. Babs is a teen-age rabbit actress, a natural performer, a long-eared clown. She bubbles over with non-stop energy, and is always jumping into a new celebrity impersonation. She uses this skill to amaze her friends, confuse her enemies, or simply to entertain herself when there&#039;s no one else around. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, Babs goes too far with her impressions. Buster may start a conversation with Babs, only to finish it with Barbra Streisand, Princess Di or whomever else Babs happens to &quot;be&quot; at the moment. This can get on Buster&#039;s nerves. Also, Babs may unwittingly hurt her friends&#039; feelings by adding them to her repertoire of impressions. She enjoys shopping, talking on the phone (sometimes to her unseen friend, Harriet), helping Buster pull a fast one, or doing anything else that could lead to some fun. Turn offs include study hall, sitting still and drama critics. Her biggest fan is Buster, her co-host and comedy partner. Like her best friend Buster, Babs feels sympathy for characters in need, and will rescue someone from an enemy by posing as a well-known celebrity or authority figure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babs is one of Acme Looniversity&#039;s most promising young performers. Despite getting in trouble now and then for doing dead-on imitations of pompous faculty members (like Elmer Fudd), Babs is easily the most popular girl in the school. Voted &quot;most likely to do anything,&quot; her favorite class is &quot;Advanced Class Clowning.&quot; Babs&#039; ears come in handy as props while doing her impressions. She can frizz them out to create a Tina Turner effect, pull them down around her head like a scarf for a woebegone little waif, or twirl them around her head in an elaborate turban. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babs also has her share of melting into a puddle in various episodes. In &lt;i&gt;Europe in 30 Minutes,&lt;/i&gt; she melts completely into a pink puddle after seeing the Royal Couple, and in &lt;i&gt;It&#039;s a Wonderful Tiny Toon Christmas Special&lt;/i&gt;, when Buster kisses her on the lips as his Christmas gift to her, she melts though her clothes into a pink puddle, with her eyes and clothes left on top of her melted form. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though Babs impersonates or parodies many different actors and fictional characters, one of the most notable characters that she parodies is Wonder Woman. She does this on a few different occasions, known as Wonder Babs instead (a bunny version of Wonder Woman), and is part of &lt;i&gt;The Just-Us League Of Supertoons&lt;/i&gt; (a parody of &lt;i&gt;The Justice League&lt;/i&gt;). Some other impressions in Babs&#039; repertoire include Charlie Brown, Popeye, Yogi Bear, Roger Rabbit , and real people such as Joan Rivers, a cockney, Scarlett O&#039;Hara, Rosanne Barr, a youthful and an elderly Katherine Hepburn, Jane Fonda, Marilyn Monroe, Groucho Marx, Billie Burke, Dolly Parton, Margaret Thatcher, Mae West, Madonna, Cher, Dr. Ruth...Babs is a one-woman show. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jessica Rabbit&lt;/b&gt; is Roger Rabbit&#039;s Toon human wife and the tritagonist in Disney/Touchstone&#039;s 1988 hybrid feature film &lt;i&gt;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the book &lt;i&gt;Who Censored Roger Rabbit&lt;/i&gt;, she was an amoral upcoming star and former comic strip character, over whom her estranged husband, fellow comic strip star Roger Rabbit, obsessed. In the film, she is re-imagined as a sultry but moral cartoon actress and singer at a Los Angeles supper club called the Ink and Paint Club. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She attests to Eddie Valiant that&amp;nbsp;&quot;I&#039;m not bad, I&#039;m just drawn that way.&quot; Indeed, she proves herself to be selfless and compassionate throughout the movie. Although she seems cool and distant, she has a soft spot for Roger, whom she married because he &quot;makes her laugh&quot;,&amp;nbsp;is a better lover than a driver and that he&#039;s magnificent and &quot;better than Goofy&quot;.&amp;nbsp;She calls him her &quot;honey bunny&quot; and &quot;darling&quot;.&amp;nbsp;She adores him beyond measure and is irrefutably loyal to him.&amp;nbsp;As proof of her love, she tells Eddie that she&#039;ll pay any price for Roger and helps prove Roger innocent by assisting with the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She makes it clear that despite what others think of her, she only has eyes for Roger and would do anything for his sake. She proves to be brave, quick-witted and intuitive; she knowingly puts herself at risk to save Roger and Eddie. Yet despite the danger, she maintains a calm composure and exhibits great skill in combat, including handling a gun. While she maintains a calm and collected demeanor for the most part, the first time she loses her composure is when Judge Doom shows her and Valiant his deadly DIP and machine to destroy Toontown, and when she and her husband are almost sprayed by the deadly substance, she sighs in relief but feels she might faint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fluttershy&lt;/b&gt; is a character from the &lt;i&gt;My Little Pony&lt;/i&gt; franchise and one of the main characters in &lt;i&gt;My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic&lt;/i&gt; who appears in &lt;i&gt;Equestria Girls&lt;/i&gt;. She first appears in the trailer when Twilight Sparkle is eating at the table. She also appears in the second trailer, carrying Angel the bunny, a red jay, and a &quot;puddy tat&quot; with a blue bow. The human version of Fluttershy has pink eyeshadow, unlike her pony version.&amp;nbsp;Fluttershy is the element of kindness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;My Little Pony: Equestria Girls&lt;/i&gt;, the human Fluttershy is first seen being bullied by Sinset Shimmer. After Twilight&amp;nbsp;sticks up for her, they introduce themselves to each other. Fluttershy acts as shyly as her pony self did when she first met Twilight, and like her pony self, opens up once she sees Spike. Fluttershy tells Twilight that she found her crown outside Canterlot High and took it into Principal Celestia. &lt;/p&gt;She later joins Twilight in the cafeteria at lunch time, explaining how things work at the high school, mentioning all the different cliques and that Sunset Shimmer rules them all. After Twilight is made a fool of by videos of her using the library&#039;s computers (filmed by Snips and Snails at Sunset Shimmer&#039;s behest), Fluttershy comes to help her, alongside the rest of the human mane six. At this point, it is&amp;nbsp;revealed that the five had been driven apart by the machinations of Sunset Shimmer. Fluttershy particularly dislikes Pinkie for ruining her silent auction for the animal shelter by bringing noisemakers. When Twilight shows them that Sunset Shimmer is responsible for everything, they reconcile, and help Twilight become Princess of the Fall Formal.</media:description>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/yKIqKxwFC1n8j4MJsvqS9DkFEbg=/fit-in/150x150/filters:no_upscale():origin()/pre00/3a81/th/pre/i/2016/282/3/2/600_000_pageviews_bunnicula_brides_by_godzilla713-dakbtea.jpg" height="90" width="150"/>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/YN0BKLrPWdYLqS_gN5GbV7kyhmk=/fit-in/300x900/filters:no_upscale():origin()/pre00/3a81/th/pre/i/2016/282/3/2/600_000_pageviews_bunnicula_brides_by_godzilla713-dakbtea.jpg" height="180" width="300"/>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/3wz1HHAvtQa8qgaDvO_IbzQJcdI=/300x200/filters:fixed_height(100,100):origin()/pre00/3a81/th/pre/i/2016/282/3/2/600_000_pageviews_bunnicula_brides_by_godzilla713-dakbtea.jpg" height="180" width="300"/>            <media:content url="https://img00.deviantart.net/2e55/i/2016/282/3/2/600_000_pageviews_bunnicula_brides_by_godzilla713-dakbtea.jpg" height="613" width="1024" medium="image"/>            
            <description>It seems that we have some cartoon cuties who on their way to become the Brides of Bunnicula, the vampire rabbit.&amp;nbsp; The star of Cartoon Network&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Bunnicula &lt;/i&gt;has gather various cartoon cuties with connections to rabbits or bunnies or animals in general.&amp;nbsp; This is to celebrate reaching 600,000 pageviews, a milestone that I never would have believe I would reach this so quickly. So because I fell behind making these milestone pictures I did a sort of Halloween picture.&amp;nbsp; We have Bunnicula looking over his newly acquired harem.&amp;nbsp; We have (left to right) Eliza of &lt;i&gt;The Wild Thornberrys,&lt;/i&gt; Lola Bunny of the &lt;i&gt;Looney Tunes Show, &lt;/i&gt;Blythe Baxter of &lt;i&gt;Littlest Pet Shop,&lt;/i&gt; Jenny of &lt;i&gt;Bucky O&#039;Hare and the Toad Wars,&lt;/i&gt; Alice of Disney&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Alice in Wonderland, &lt;/i&gt;Babs Bunny of the &lt;i&gt;Tiny Toons Adventures,&lt;/i&gt; Jessica Rabbit of &lt;i&gt;Who Framed Roger Rabbit?,&amp;nbsp; &lt;/i&gt;Fluttershy of &lt;i&gt;My Little Pony Friendship is Magic: Equestria Girls.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bunnicula&lt;/b&gt; (voiced by Chris Kattan): The titular character of the show, Bunnicula is a vampire rabbit, and was once the pet of Count Dracula. He is very different from the original version of the character who appears in the books. As it was said by Chester, Bunnicula was found in a locked chamber in the cellar of the apartment complex that Mina, Harold, and Chester now live in. Also, he is shown to have a few vampire traits such as hiding from sunlight, sleeping in a casket, flying with bat wings, and draining juice from vegetables with his fangs. It has been seen that he cannot talk except for a few words (although Harold seems to understand him just fine). He cares for Mina a great deal but tends to cause mischief that yields supernatural consequences. Bunnicula sucks juices from vegetables (just like in the book) but different kinds of vegetables cause some kind of reaction in Bunnicula (sugar beets make him hyperactive and speedy, squashes enlarge his feet, onions make him cry powerful jet streams of tears, garlic turns him into a skeleton bunny, chili peppers make him breathe fire, rutabagas give him telekinesis, turnips turn the house upside-down, wasabi makes him spontaneously combust, leeks give him spider legs, eggplants turn him into a huge and hideous three-eyed monster rabbit, etc.). In the books, it was unclear whether or not Bunnicula had vampiric powers although he was somehow able to get in and out of his cage without opening the door. Unlike his Ruby-Spears incarnation, Bunnicula&#039;s ears turn into bat wings to fly. He also speaks very limited English on rare occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elizabeth &#039;Eliza&#039; Thornberry&lt;/b&gt;, is a cute and beautiful 12 year-old tomboy whom, unknown to most, except her older sister, Debbie (as of the movie), gained the ability to speak with animals after an encounter with an African shaman, two years prior to the start of the series at age ten. Despite her cuteness and beauty, Eliza is portrayed as a geek by her extensive zoological knowledge and her glasses, braces and by occasionally standing pigeon-toed. She has freckles and shoulder-length red-orange hair that is usually worn in braided pigtails with two red elastic bands and occasionally a ponytail. She almost always wears a yellow dress, though later in the series she sports other clothes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lola Bunny&lt;/b&gt; is the secondary&amp;nbsp;tritagonist of the Looney Tunes Show franchise.&amp;nbsp; She is Bugs Bunny&#039;s beautiful, bubbly girlfriend. Lola talks a mile-a-minute, can be absent-minded on occasion,&amp;nbsp;and has a way of getting what she wants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lola first appears in the episode Members Only, at the Royal Oaks Glen Oaks Oakwood Oaks Country Club (or the R.O.G.O.O.O.C.C.) where she meets Bugs, while playing tennis when she hits him with multiple tennis balls as she&#039;s practicing her swing. They are both instantly attracted to one another, so they decide to go out for dinner and a movie. However, Bugs quickly finds out on their date that Lola&#039;s high-spirited personality causes her to talk constantly (speaking what&#039;s on her mind at all times), be forgetful or confused about certain facts, and become so absent-minded that she even mistakes the trailers before the movie as the movie itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the date Bugs decides to avoid Lola, having become annoyed and embarrassed by her quirks (going so far as to say their first date was the worst of his life). Lola, on the other hand, found their date to be the best of her life and tries to get a hold of Bugs through constant phone calls and 128 emails, all of which Bugs ignores. Lola then &quot;runs into&quot; Bugs at the dry cleaners, grocery store and gym. Lola startles Bugs at the gym, which causes an accident that results in weights being dropped on Bugs&#039;s neck. He tells Lola he can&#039;t see her anymore, saying he&#039;s not sure if they&#039;re right for each other. Lola, devastated, starts crying uncontrollably until Bugs exclaims he didn&#039;t mean it, and to his dismay and Lola&#039;s excitement, agrees to go out with her again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an attempt to end things, Bugs dresses up as a woman at the R.O.G.O.O.O.C.C. and tries to convince Lola that he&#039;ll end up breaking her heart. When Bugs comes back to Lola without his disguise on, Lola reveals that the only thing she took away from the conversation with the &quot;ugly woman&quot; is that Bugs is a bad boy, making her even more attracted to him. Lola then notices her parents and introduces them to Bugs. Her dad says that Lola has told them so much about him, however Bugs decries that she doesn&#039;t know anything about him. Lola and her parents simply laugh his comment off. Bugs excuses himself and goes to the bathroom and talks to himself in the mirror in an attempt to convince himself to end it with Lola. He takes a mint from the bathroom attendant before he leaves, but drops it before making another break-up attempt. It rolls underneath Lola&#039;s seat, and when he reaches down to pick it up, Lola thinks he is proposing to her and screams yes. Lola is quick to plan and organize the wedding with Pepe Le Pew, the club&#039;s wedding planner. In a twist of events, at the wedding, she runs off with Pepe, saying she is in love with him, much to Bugs&#039; relief.But in future episodes,Lola is Bug&#039;s girlfriend so eventually he breaks up with Pepe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blythe Baxter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the cute and beautiful main character in the series Littlest Pet Shop.

Although she seems cool and distant, she has a soft spot for Roger, whom she married because he &quot;makes her laugh&quot;,&amp;nbsp;is a better lover than a driver and that he&#039;s magnificent and &quot;better than Goofy&quot;.&amp;nbsp;She calls him her &quot;honey bunny&quot; and &quot;darling&quot;.&amp;nbsp;She adores him beyond measure and is irrefutably loyal to him.&amp;nbsp;As proof of her love, she tells Eddie that she&#039;ll pay any price for Roger and helps prove Roger innocent by assisting with the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She makes it clear that despite what others think of her, she only has eyes for Roger and would do anything for his sake. She proves to be brave, quick-witted and intuitive; she knowingly puts herself at risk to save Roger and Eddie. Yet despite the danger, she maintains a calm composure and exhibits great skill in combat, including handling a gun. While she maintains a calm and collected demeanor for the most part, the first time she loses her composure is when Judge Doom shows her and Valiant his deadly DIP and machine to destroy Toontown, and when she and her husband are almost sprayed by the deadly substance, she sighs in relief but feels she might faint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fluttershy&lt;/b&gt; is a character from the &lt;i&gt;My Little Pony&lt;/i&gt; franchise and one of the main characters in &lt;i&gt;My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic&lt;/i&gt; who appears in &lt;i&gt;Equestria Girls&lt;/i&gt;. She first appears in the trailer when Twilight Sparkle is eating at the table. She also appears in the second trailer, carrying Angel the bunny, a red jay, and a &quot;puddy tat&quot; with a blue bow. The human version of Fluttershy has pink eyeshadow, unlike her pony version.&amp;nbsp;Fluttershy is the element of kindness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;My Little Pony: Equestria Girls&lt;/i&gt;, the human Fluttershy is first seen being bullied by Sinset Shimmer. After Twilight&amp;nbsp;sticks up for her, they introduce themselves to each other. Fluttershy acts as shyly as her pony self did when she first met Twilight, and like her pony self, opens up once she sees Spike. Fluttershy tells Twilight that she found her crown outside Canterlot High and took it into Principal Celestia. &lt;/p&gt;She later joins Twilight in the cafeteria at lunch time, explaining how things work at the high school, mentioning all the different cliques and that Sunset Shimmer rules them all. After Twilight is made a fool of by videos of her using the library&#039;s computers (filmed by Snips and Snails at Sunset Shimmer&#039;s behest), Fluttershy comes to help her, alongside the rest of the human mane six. At this point, it is&amp;nbsp;revealed that the five had been driven apart by the machinations of Sunset Shimmer. Fluttershy particularly dislikes Pinkie for ruining her silent auction for the animal shelter by bringing noisemakers. When Twilight shows them that Sunset Shimmer is responsible for everything, they reconcile, and help Twilight become Princess of the Fall Formal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://t00.deviantart.net/3wz1HHAvtQa8qgaDvO_IbzQJcdI=/300x200/filters:fixed_height(100,100):origin()/pre00/3a81/th/pre/i/2016/282/3/2/600_000_pageviews_bunnicula_brides_by_godzilla713-dakbtea.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thumbnail&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>            </item>

The series was created by Donald Bellisario, and starred Scott Bakula as Dr. Sam Beckett, a physicist from six years in the future (during the series&#039; original run) who becomes lost in time following a time travel experiment, temporarily taking the places of other people to &quot;put right what once went wrong&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Dean Stockwell co-starred as Al Calavicci, Sam&#039;s womanizing, cigar-smoking sidekick and best friend, who appeared as a hologram that only Sam, animals, young children, and the mentally ill could see and hear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The series featured a mix of comedy, drama and melodrama, social commentary, nostalgia and science fiction, which won it a broad range of fans. One of its trademarks is that at the end of each episode, Sam &quot;leaps&quot; into the setting for the next episode, usually uttering a dismayed &quot;Oh, boy!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite struggling on Friday nights at 9 PM in its brief first season, NBC surprisingly renewed the series because of its impressive 18-49 demographics. The series was moved to Wednesdays at 10 PM where it flourished against other fan-favorite series, Wiseguy and China Beach. It was moved twice away from Wednesdays (to Fridays at 8 PM in the fall of 1990 and to Tuesdays at 8 PM in the fall of 1992) where it floundered. The series finale aired in its successful Wednesday 10 PM slot in May 1993.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2004 and 2007, Quantum Leap was ranked #15 and #19 on TV Guide&#039;s &quot;Top Cult Shows Ever&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Show Summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show&#039;s premise and the pattern of each episode is established in the first episode.[6] Sam appears in the past with no memory of who he is or how he got there. Referred to frequently throughout the series as a &quot;swiss-cheesed brain&quot;, Sam&#039;s partial amnesia prevents him from remembering most of the details of his own life; all he knows is that he&#039;s not who everyone in the past seems to think he is. Rear Admiral Al Calavicci (Dean Stockwell), a senior naval officer, Naval Aviator and Sam&#039;s best friend, appears to him as a hologram and explains that Sam is the victim of a time travel experiment that went &quot;a little kaka.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now Sam is lost in time, and his colleagues are unable to bring him back to his own time. Series creator Donald Bellisario once said in an interview that he got the idea for the series from movies like Heaven Can Wait (1978), a remake of the 1941 film Here Comes Mr. Jordan. Bellisario felt the premise, if handled correctly and put in a science fiction setting, could work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam, beginning his time traveling experiment in the (then future) year 1995, soon learns that the man he replaced in the past (or &quot;leaped into&quot;, in the show&#039;s parlance) is an Air Force test pilot who was about to be killed during a botched flight. Al explains that their best theory to what&#039;s going on is that &quot;God, time, fate, or whatever&quot; wants Sam to save the man before he can &quot;leap out.&quot; Sam does so, but instead of returning to his own time he leaps into yet another person&#039;s life and once again tries to &quot;put right what once went wrong.&quot; In each episode, Sam leaps into a new host, often finding himself in dangerous, embarrassing, or otherwise compromising positions, and with Al&#039;s help (and that of his colleagues, who have access to information from the future), he tries to right some wrong or misfortune in the life of that person or someone close to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Physics of &quot;Leaping&quot;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Al explains the concept of the experiment to Sam in the first episode during his initial period of amnesia using a simple analogy. Using a piece of string, Al explains that one end represents Sam&#039;s date of birth while the other represents Sam&#039;s date of death. Connecting the two ends together will, in effect, form a loop. The looped string is then scrunched up in one&#039;s hand and various parts of the piece of string will inevitably intersect and touch each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By leaping at the intersections to a different section of the string, Sam can travel to a different date within his own lifetime. The leap seems instantaneous to Sam but Al explains in the pilot episode that he spent a week traveling in time between the moment he leaped out of the Air Force test pilot and the moment he leaped into his next host.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In early episodes, it was unclear whether Sam&#039;s mind was leaping into other people&#039;s bodies or whether his mind and body leaped together. Later episodes make it clear, however, that Sam&#039;s entire body has traveled through time and that &quot;the illusion of [his host&#039;s] physical aura&quot; surrounds him, making him look and sound like that person to those with whom he interacts in the past, as well as to Al (in later episodes, however, this changes and Al sees him as Sam). Likewise, Sam&#039;s counterpart in the future is surrounded by a similar aura and looks and sounds like Sam to people at the project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sam is also able to transcend the physical limitations of his host, being able to see after leaping into a blind pianist, walk while sharing the existence of a legless Vietnam veteran (although it appeared to outside observers, when Sam was walking, that his host was floating), swim after leaping into a chimpanzee, and retain the strength of an adult man after leaping into a child, an elderly woman, and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This also made it possible for Sam to procreate with Abigail in the three-part &#039;Trilogy&#039; episode, (In Season 4, episodes 8, 9 and 10) and thus his daughter, Samantha Jo, shares his genes rather than Will&#039;s, whom he leaped into for Part 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In many instances it is shown that Sam also retains some very basic memories from his host, such as where he lives and other information that helps to function in his host&#039;s day-to-day life. In one extreme case, Sam occupied a mentally disabled man and began to feel as though the host&#039;s disability was affecting him as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the time in which Sam occupies a host, the host is simultaneously transported to the time travel facility where Sam made his initial leap – effectively switching places with them. It is never explicitly stated what happens to the people Sam has leaped into after he leaves, but it is assumed that the persons return to their timelines with amnesia of the events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Conversely, in the episode &quot;Roberto!&quot;, Sam suggests that the people he leaps into remember being in the waiting room at Project Quantum Leap. This opens the possibility that the Swiss-cheesed memories of leaping may allow people to remember Sam&#039;s experiences as their own upon returning to their own time and move forward toward a positive future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Similarly, in the episode &quot;Return of the Evil Leaper&quot;, Sam instructs Al to talk with the host in the waiting room, as he realises that without working through his emotional and psychological problems, he will continue to endanger his life once he has returned to his body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Brushes with History:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show often featured scenes where Sam briefly encounters a famous historical figure or is tangentially involved in a historically significant event, but which is unrelated to the episode&#039;s story. For example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;Star-Crossed&quot;, Sam has to get his future fiancée (Teri Hatcher) to reconnect with her father, who is a colonel in the army. On June 17, 1972, Sam tries to bluff his way past the security guards in the lobby of the Watergate Hotel. He is ejected, but Sam manages to find a door with a piece of tape over the latch. He and his future wife sneak in but the guard, noticing that their car is still there, does a check of the outside doors and reports a break-in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;The Right Hand of God&quot;, Sam bets on Muhammad Ali to beat George Foreman and wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;How the Tess Was Won&quot;, Sam helps a young Buddy Holly with the words to the song &quot;Peggy Sue&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;Double Identity&quot;, Sam causes the Northeast Blackout of 1965 when he asks someone to plug in a 1000 watt hair dryer at a fraternity house at 111 Erie Drive, Buffalo (New York) at 5:15 EST on November 9, 1965.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the episode &quot;Camikazi Kid&quot;, Sam demonstrates how to do the moonwalk to a boy called Mikey (Jackson)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;Play It Again, Seymour&quot;, Sam leaps into a man who looks a lot like Humphrey Bogart and in 1953 New York runs into a young Woody Allen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;Good Morning, Peoria&quot;, Sam helps Chubby Checker to perfect the Twist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;Thou Shalt Not...&quot;, Sam performs the as-yet uninvented Heimlich Maneuver on a choking man who is addressed as Dr. Heimlich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the episode &quot;Jimmy&quot;, set in 1964, Sam tells the story of Star Wars to Jimmy&#039;s nephew Cory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;Sea Bride&quot;, a voice can be heard over the ship&#039;s intercom saying, &quot;Calling Mrs. Thatcher, Mrs. Margaret Thatcher.&quot; In that same episode he asks a loanshark mobster shaking him down if &quot;He&#039;s going to offer Sam as the Leapee an offer he can not refuse.&quot; Taking a line from The Godfather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;Leap of Faith&quot;, Sam recounts to a young boxer a scene from the film Rocky; the boxer&#039;s locker door is tagged S. Stallone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the episode &quot;The Boogieman&quot;, Sam&#039;s stories help inspire a young aspiring horror writer, Stephen King.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;Rebel Without a Clue&quot;, Sam pleads with Jack Kerouac to talk a young woman out of pursuing a dangerous life on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;It&#039;s a Wonderful Leap&quot;, Sam, as a cab driver in 1958, advises a 12-year-old Donald Trump that investing in New York City real estate would be a good way to get rich, and that there will one day be a crystal tower on 57th Street and 5th Avenue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;Lee Harvey Oswald&quot;, Sam had thought he was to prevent the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, but instead successfully prevented First Lady Jackie Kennedy from being shot. It is explained to Sam that in the original history, both Kennedys were shot, implying that we are living in Sam&#039;s altered history. Sam also runs into the series creator Donald Bellisario who did serve in the Marines with Lee Harvey Oswald.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;Goodbye Norma Jean&quot;, Sam inspires the title of the last film Marilyn Monroe ever completed. In Sam&#039;s original timeline she died before The Misfits was made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;Dr. Ruth&quot;, Sam leaps into Ruth Westheimer to deal with a case of sexual harassment in the past. While defending a victim of sexual harassment from her harasser, a woman later revealed to be Anita Hill stops to listen to what Sam is saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;The Leap Between the States,&quot; Sam leaps into his own great-grandfather during the American Civil War and helps Isaac, a slave operating a stop in the Underground Railroad, get out of Virginia. At the end of the episode, Sam finds out Isaac intends to take on the last name &quot;King&quot; after being freed. Al explains that he is the ancestor of Martin Luther King, Jr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the episode &quot;Memphis Melody&quot;, where Sam leaps into Elvis Presley, a young saxophonist from Hope (Arkansas) in a music contest is addressed as &quot;Little Billy C&quot;, future President Bill Clinton.&lt;/i&gt;</media:description>            <media:thumbnail url="https://img00.deviantart.net/4511/i/2012/093/1/e/quantum_leap_intro___opening_in_flash_animation_by_gamera68-d4uwx3k.jpg" height="150" width="150"/>            <media:thumbnail url="https://img00.deviantart.net/4511/i/2012/093/1/e/quantum_leap_intro___opening_in_flash_animation_by_gamera68-d4uwx3k.jpg" height="150" width="150"/>            <media:thumbnail url="https://img00.deviantart.net/4511/i/2012/093/1/e/quantum_leap_intro___opening_in_flash_animation_by_gamera68-d4uwx3k.jpg" height="150" width="150"/>            <media:content url="https://img00.deviantart.net/4511/i/2012/093/1/e/quantum_leap_intro___opening_in_flash_animation_by_gamera68-d4uwx3k.jpg" height="150" width="150"/>

For example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;Star-Crossed&quot;, Sam has to get his future fiancée (Teri Hatcher) to reconnect with her father, who is a colonel in the army. On June 17, 1972, Sam tries to bluff his way past the security guards in the lobby of the Watergate Hotel. He is ejected, but Sam manages to find a door with a piece of tape over the latch. He and his future wife sneak in but the guard, noticing that their car is still there, does a check of the outside doors and reports a break-in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;The Right Hand of God&quot;, Sam bets on Muhammad Ali to beat George Foreman and wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;How the Tess Was Won&quot;, Sam helps a young Buddy Holly with the words to the song &quot;Peggy Sue&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;Double Identity&quot;, Sam causes the Northeast Blackout of 1965 when he asks someone to plug in a 1000 watt hair dryer at a fraternity house at 111 Erie Drive, Buffalo (New York) at 5:15 EST on November 9, 1965.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the episode &quot;Camikazi Kid&quot;, Sam demonstrates how to do the moonwalk to a boy called Mikey (Jackson)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;Play It Again, Seymour&quot;, Sam leaps into a man who looks a lot like Humphrey Bogart and in 1953 New York runs into a young Woody Allen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;Good Morning, Peoria&quot;, Sam helps Chubby Checker to perfect the Twist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;Thou Shalt Not...&quot;, Sam performs the as-yet uninvented Heimlich Maneuver on a choking man who is addressed as Dr. Heimlich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the episode &quot;Jimmy&quot;, set in 1964, Sam tells the story of Star Wars to Jimmy&#039;s nephew Cory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;Sea Bride&quot;, a voice can be heard over the ship&#039;s intercom saying, &quot;Calling Mrs. Thatcher, Mrs. Margaret Thatcher.&quot; In that same episode he asks a loanshark mobster shaking him down if &quot;He&#039;s going to offer Sam as the Leapee an offer he can not refuse.&quot; Taking a line from The Godfather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;Leap of Faith&quot;, Sam recounts to a young boxer a scene from the film Rocky; the boxer&#039;s locker door is tagged S. Stallone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the episode &quot;The Boogieman&quot;, Sam&#039;s stories help inspire a young aspiring horror writer, Stephen King.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;Rebel Without a Clue&quot;, Sam pleads with Jack Kerouac to talk a young woman out of pursuing a dangerous life on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;It&#039;s a Wonderful Leap&quot;, Sam, as a cab driver in 1958, advises a 12-year-old Donald Trump that investing in New York City real estate would be a good way to get rich, and that there will one day be a crystal tower on 57th Street and 5th Avenue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;Lee Harvey Oswald&quot;, Sam had thought he was to prevent the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, but instead successfully prevented First Lady Jackie Kennedy from being shot. It is explained to Sam that in the original history, both Kennedys were shot, implying that we are living in Sam&#039;s altered history. Sam also runs into the series creator Donald Bellisario who did serve in the Marines with Lee Harvey Oswald.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;Goodbye Norma Jean&quot;, Sam inspires the title of the last film Marilyn Monroe ever completed. In Sam&#039;s original timeline she died before The Misfits was made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;Dr. Ruth&quot;, Sam leaps into Ruth Westheimer to deal with a case of sexual harassment in the past. While defending a victim of sexual harassment from her harasser, a woman later revealed to be Anita Hill stops to listen to what Sam is saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &quot;The Leap Between the States,&quot; Sam leaps into his own great-grandfather during the American Civil War and helps Isaac, a slave operating a stop in the Underground Railroad, get out of Virginia. At the end of the episode, Sam finds out Isaac intends to take on the last name &quot;King&quot; after being freed. Al explains that he is the ancestor of Martin Luther King, Jr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the episode &quot;Memphis Melody&quot;, where Sam leaps into Elvis Presley, a young saxophonist from Hope (Arkansas) in a music contest is addressed as &quot;Little Billy C&quot;, future President Bill Clinton.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://img00.deviantart.net/4511/i/2012/093/1/e/quantum_leap_intro___opening_in_flash_animation_by_gamera68-d4uwx3k.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thumbnail&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>            </item>

British and French intervention yielded no peace but did allow the Louisiana Free State to emerge in the territory they occupied. Texas broke with the rest of the Confederacy and took much of the southwest with it, later fishing in the muddy waters of the extended struggle between the Republican North and Imperial South of Mexico to snag some new territories. The Mormons of Deseret jumped at their chance to reestablish their independent &amp;ldquo;republic of the saints&amp;rdquo;. And so on and so forth. A rump United States eventually emerged from the Chaos Years with the reunification of the east and the mid-western states, but internal woes prevented it from pursuing further efforts at expansion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;German Unification was not butterflied away, and German size and strength and the bellicose nature of its leadership inevitable provoked defensive combinations, which in turn led to claims of &amp;ldquo;encirclement&amp;rdquo;, and due to Some Damn Fool Thing in the Balkans (albeit without Serbian complicity) provoked the outbreak of the Great War in 1910. With North America too divided against itself to send aid, even in the case of provocative German submarine warfare, and the US not rich enough to extend endless loans to the anti-German alliance, the Germans were better placed to win the war of attrition. Although in the end the French remained stubbornly non-stereotypical, refusing to surrender even after a *Michael offensive had reached Paris (which became a hell of house-to-house fighting) economic exhaustion and near-famine conditions in Britain eventually brought the two sides to the negotiating table. France lost territory and colonies, but avoided any truly crippling reparations, and managed to keep its army (even if it couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford it). In the east, German successes were more absolute: Russia collapsed into revolution, and German forces pushed far eastwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;France, feeling it had been sold down the river by its British allies (which gave up very little in the peace treaty), sunk into political turmoil. The Germans made an effort to restore a puppet Tsar to the Russian throne, but fanatical resistance by the Red Revolutionaries (not OTL Bolsheviks, but pretty ruthless chaps all the same) combined with the possibility of a French stab in the back eventually led them to accept half a loaf in the rump &amp;ldquo;Grand Duchy of St. Petersburg&amp;rdquo;, the legitimacy of which was loudly denied by both Reds and the few surviving members of the royal family which had managed to make it to exile in Russian Alaska/Alayeska (never sold to a USA with no west coast).&lt;br /&gt;Austria-Hungary eventually reached its Past Sell Date and was incorporated wholly or partially into the German Empire. The French settled down under an unpleasant left-authoritarian regime vaguely reminiscent of Baath Party Iraq, and began looking for new allies against Germany. The Japanese stumbled into China as OTL. Under the very different initial conditions, the OTL Great Depression was butterflied away, and there was a brief period of &amp;ldquo;d&amp;eacute;tente&amp;rdquo; in the later 30s and 40s: a feeble &amp;ldquo;League of Nations&amp;rdquo; was set up as an international forum, and there was some talk about peacefully resolving the mess in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, the political weather turned icy again. Violent protest and resistance against German rule in Eastern Europe brought brutal repression and a sharp turn to the right in German politics. Britain and Japan clashed for influence in Asia, leading to the outbreak of war in 1948, in which a new generation of Japanese ships and planes proved superior to anything the UK could field, and in the end the British Empire was pushed west of Ceylon. Australia and New Zealand were neutralized, and the British were kicked out of India. Japan had planned to make India a puppet, but Indian nationalists had ideas of their own, and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be Japan&amp;rsquo;s Little Brown Buddy. The Japanese, after a short war that showed them an outright conquest of India would be a pain, settled for half a loaf in the form of a Bengali satellite state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Germany developed the atom bomb in 1951, which provided a great way to intimidate uppity Russians and Frenchmen, which were threatened with incineration of their major cities if they tried to develop nuclear arsenals of their own. France, unpleasant as its government was, by the 1950s not that serious a worry, with a much weaker economy than Germany and less than 2/5 of its population. No, a new bogeyman had arrived on the global scene with the defeat of Great Britain: the Japanese Empire, whose defeat of the White Man (in British form) had made German blood boil, and whose snagging of rebellion-torn Dutch Indonesia was practically a slap to the face of the Netherlands &amp;ldquo;protector.&amp;rdquo; German politicians called for a crusade in the name of Whitey against the sinister Orientals, who fully reciprocated the heated rhetoric. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That the British should develop a bomb of their own fast enough to make German nuclear blackmail somewhat impractical was no great blow to German confidence &amp;ndash; fellow Germanics, after all &amp;ndash; but the speed at which the Japanese did the same was rather shocking. Thus began the atomic Arms Race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By 1969, both sides had enough bombs to incinerate each other twice over and the missiles to deliver them (missile and rocket technology had progressed faster than OTL: the first man on the moon - a German - planted the imperial eagle in the regolith in 1960). The whole world was increasingly being pressured to take sides, as the world&amp;rsquo;s leading powers growled at each other from either end of the Russian &amp;ldquo;buffer&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NATIONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1969, people speak of &amp;ldquo;Central North America&amp;rdquo;, the area between Canada (once again part of the British Empire after the Troubles of the 30s) and the backward nations of OTLs Central America, where the major political actors of the continent trade, quarrel, make and break alliances. Starting to the northwest, the Czars of Russia still rule in Alayeska, albeit now constrained by a Parliament. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit more populous than our Alaska, with a bit over two million inhabitants thanks to refugees from the Russian Socialist Union, economically dependent on oil and other extractive industries and militarily dependent on an alliance with the British Empire to keep the Socialists from crossing the Bering Straits and reconquering them. Not that this is a really big worry nowadays: the Union has mellowed over the last couple decades, and relationships are nowadays fairly cordial, although the Czar&amp;rsquo;s insistence in titling himself &amp;ldquo;Czar of all the Russias&amp;rdquo; still ruffles feathers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pacifica (previously the Oregon Republic, decided on a name-change after British Columbia jumped ship from Canada during the Troubles) is a prosperous social democracy, whose excellent trade relations with the Empire of Japan leads to a dispiriting degree of self-censorship in its mass media whenever the subject of Asian Atrocities comes up. The disagreeably racially and economically stratified republic of California has had a left-wing revolution and is now a People&amp;rsquo;s Republic: killings of former Oppressors of the People have been refreshingly few, although a lot of people lost their fortunes and property to the People (State). Economic difficulties and hostility from their conservative Texan and Mormon neighbors has led to an alliance of convenience with the Empire of Japan, Imperialist scumbags as they may be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texas is near anarcho-capitalistic, is a leader in high-tech, and has the highest level of gun violence in North America, which its inhabitants consider an acceptable price to pay for the right to own your own bazooka. Still a relatively small country, population-wise, Texas makes up for it with an attitude suitable for a country ten times its size. It is a perpetual annoyance to their puritanical Mormon neighbors in Deseret, a near-theocracy which has banned both alcohol and cigarettes and a level of social discipline and conformity which impresses even the Japanese. Polygamy remains legal, although nowadays sufficiently closely regulated that it&amp;rsquo;s usually only wealthy men who have multiple wives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the northern and central portions of the former US under dispute between Oregon, Deseret, the Western States of America (the US being temporarily even more fragmented than it would be in 1969), and even Canada, a number of native tribes banded together and managed to create a neutral &amp;ldquo;buffer&amp;rdquo; state between the Anglo powers. Demographically boosted by expulsions of Native Americans from elsewhere (&amp;ldquo;look, you Injuns have a homeland now. So git.&amp;rdquo;) &amp;ndash; extensive ethnic cleansing of &amp;ldquo;troublesome&amp;rdquo; tribes from Texas, the betrayal of the Civilized Tribes of *Oklahoma by their wartime Confederate allies &amp;ndash; the nation that in time became known as the &amp;ldquo;Great Spirit Alliance&amp;rdquo; survived, beat off some filibustering attempts by its neighbors, and gained international recognition. Nowadays it is the poorest country north of Mexico, and still almost as thinly populated as OTL Mongolia, but its people are free and proud and 100% enlisted in the state militia in case the white man goes on the warpath again. Currently, there is a fair degree of political turmoil as many complain that the new emigrants from Latin America (the Spirit Alliance still holds itself as a refuge for persecuted Amerindians anywhere), many of whom are Spanish-speaking Catholics, are not &amp;ldquo;proper&amp;rdquo; Indians and should not be allowed in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Texas overrunning much of the territory of their Republican opponents and continued French support, the Imperial faction remained in power in Mexico, although they demonstrate little gratitude to either. With a more stable political situation since the 1880s, Mexico is more developed than OTL 1969, and having a royal family of German descent give the country a certain respectability in the eyes of the Reich, which is useful in various ways, although Mexico is careful to avoid too close an entanglement with Germany. Louisiana Free State is neutral, French-English bilingual, a hub of trade, a center of diplomacy (Switzerland is too much in bed with the Germans nowadays to make a good neutral meeting place), and one of the best places on earth to have a good time. It&amp;rsquo;s also black-majority and works very hard to make itself useful to the Great Powers, the hot angry breath of the Confederacy always on the back of its collective neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Said Confederacy is a middling-sized power still suffering political turmoil a year after the assassination of President Lee (apparently by members of her own party) after she collected every favor she was owed to ram through the nations&amp;rsquo; first Civil Rights bill, which has held up in spite of efforts to reverse it. Black Confederates, a third of the population, still face severe discrimination, but they now have at least a chance for legal recourse, the ability to vote, and the ability to move their place of residence without getting police and government permission. And they have a hero. The Confederacy includes Cuba and Puerto Rico and the Yucatan &amp;ndash; efforts to expand its holdings into Africa were baffled by the UK navy, a conflict most Confederates prefer not to think about due to the whole &amp;ldquo;reestablishing the slave trade under another name&amp;rdquo; thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The United States remains the dominant power on the continent, the most populous, most powerful, and economically important nation, with an economy not far behind that of Germany proper if still rather smaller than the German Block considered as a whole. Many of its politicians look to the reunification of English-speaking North America, possibly even including Canada. With higher barriers to immigration from the south, it is whiter than OTL US at the time, and more social-democratic: labor is powerful, and there is more of a sense of transatlantic links with Europe. (Alliance with Germany is another idea occasionally floated by US politicians, although due to increased German authoritarianism in recent decades it does not play as well in Peoria.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Latin America is a checkerboard where the Germans and the Japanese (and to a lesser extent, the US and Britain, and the Red Russians) strive and scheme for influence. As OTL, the economies are generally fairly backwards and dominated by foreign companies, although some of the dumber Marxist ideas are absent. Brazil, where the Empire took his time to get rid of slavery, remains a monarchy, and has regional ambitions which (as it&amp;rsquo;s more intelligent politicians sourly know) will probably be baffled by Germany or Japan putting their oar in. OTLs French Guiana is German and a major base for the German space program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battered by their defeat at the hands of the Japanese, the British have withdrawn into heavily armed neutrality (on good days, its &amp;ldquo;glorious isolation.&amp;rdquo;) They still control much of Africa, but are increasingly moving away from direct rule to rule through local autonomous regimes and puppets (at least in this world they avoided lumping together such incompatible bits as north and south Nigeria or Equatoria with Muslim Sudan). Canada suffers from an increasingly noisy &amp;ldquo;Free Quebec&amp;rdquo; problem, which the British are trying to manage by working towards a Quebec still integrated through the wider empire, if not Canada specifically. The breakaway of the Boers at least allowed for an early universal democratization of the Cape Colony, and the economy is picking up again after a tough period in the 50s. The British can also boast that they have managed to maintain their democratic form of government (in spite of a few sticky spots in the late 20s and early 30s), which is more than you can say for the French.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rather nasty French regime is frustrated: its goal of avenging the humiliations of &amp;rsquo;15 seems further away than ever, now that Germany has all those nukes. Under the circumstances the general population is beginning to ask whether they really need all those secret police and so on if it&amp;rsquo;s not going to help re the Germans, which the government deals with by cranking the repression up. Forbidden from developing nukes, the French have been developing a chemical and biological arsenal of some size instead, which they feel will at least act as a deterrent when they let people know about it. They lead a small group of malcontent nations referred to as &amp;ldquo;The New Entente&amp;rdquo;, including a *fascist Italy Permanently Pissed over Venetia, a Greece very unhappy about its lack of Balkan spoils, a right-wing Spanish regime which owes its existence to French aid against their own socialist revolutionaries, and the Egyptians, whose French-derived form of government is even more pure Saddam Hussein quill than France&amp;rsquo;s (France is run by committee: Egypt, by strongman. He even has an excellent mustache). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Boer state is a Germany ally and has even worse racial issues than our South Africa at the time: a few years back some revelations about Boer plans for &amp;ldquo;population control&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;social management&amp;rdquo; were so shocking that the government was forced to loudly claim it was the work of Radical Elements, and several scapegoats fled into exile (supposedly just a hop ahead of the police, which has not been exactly energetic in seeking extradition since). Liberia, after US intervention in a local civil war, has become a US territory: Confederates cynically note that the supposedly color-blind US seems in no hurry to make it an actual state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The German Reich dominates most of Europe. It is more populous than the same area OTL 1969, having avoided the losses of WWII and attracted rather more immigration. There is some talk of maybe absorbing Switzerland and the Netherlands, but their governments are cooperative enough and their economies firmly incorporated into the German &amp;ldquo;system&amp;rdquo; running from la Manche to the Volga. Why make trouble, when there is enough of it in Eastern Europe, whose vassal German royal families often sit uneasily on their thrones, and the mellowing of the Russian Socialist Union has had the unfortunate effect of making the Ukrainians and the Cossacks less scared of the notion of striking out on their own. Antisemitism is on the rise again in these troubled times, although actual anti-Jewish legal measures so far fail to make it through the Reichstag. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Germany leads the world in theoretical science, but is hotly contested by Japan when it comes to making practical applications of its technology. The total size of the economy of the German &amp;ldquo;Block&amp;rdquo; of nations is still somewhat larger than the much more populous Japanese sphere, and standards of living are much higher: still, German romantic pessimism is quite evident in popular culture, and Germans worry a great deal about falling behind the Yellow Menace. (German popular magazines, books, movies, etc. remain highly &amp;ldquo;politically incorrect.&amp;rdquo;). At least the people have confidence in the current Kaiserin, a middle-aged &amp;ldquo;woman of iron&amp;rdquo; who can best be described as the unholy love-child of Bismark and Margaret Thatcher. (The aging former Kaiser and the German parliament did the legal work to pass the succession to the female line after a tragic zeppelin accident took out the heir presumptive and the backup kid, leaving the next three males in the line of succession an alcoholic, a lunatic and a valiant soldier who, alas, was also flamboyantly, even extravagantly gay.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ottoman Empire is a solid German ally. It is often called the Turkish Empire, given that [1] the Sultan is essentially a figurehead of the dominant political party and [2] Turkish nationalism has become a major part of said party&amp;rsquo;s ideology (it&amp;rsquo;s also the only legal party). The Arabs are understandably unhappy about this. The Ottomans are a bit annoyed about the German-Japanese rivalry, which in their opinion distracts from the more important task of destroying the Russian regime and liberating central Asia. The Monarchy is in much better shape to the east in Iran, where the Shah&amp;rsquo;s regime is modernizing with Japanese aid and savage repression of any opposition to his great power ambitions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Germany&amp;rsquo;s forward listening bases and a number of military assets are located in the Indian Federation, a somewhat politically complex union of states held together mostly by fear of the Japanese, Muslim-Hindu bickering generally staying non-violent. India is a German ally out of necessity: it needs an atom-powered protector, and the Germans are the most credible when it comes to facing down the Japanese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Russian Socialist Union was never as sociopathic as Stalin&amp;rsquo;s regime, and have mellowed since a reform faction came to power in the late 40&amp;rsquo;s, but it is still a one-party state with universal mobilization and a rather paranoid outlook, lying at it does between two hostile and nuclear-armed superpowers. Recent odd seismic activity in the Lop Nor has led various Russian officials to become surprisingly bad at understanding the German and Japanese languages and easily baffled by the simplest of questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Japanese Empire is the world&amp;rsquo;s most populous empire, and its most ruthlessly oppressive one. Its huge domains are divided into puppet regimes, colonial regimes, areas of military &amp;ldquo;special administration&amp;rdquo; (like colonies, but with more salutary massacres), and areas directly incorporated into the homeland. Taiwan, after generations of cultural re-education, is nowadays considered almost &amp;ldquo;Nipponese&amp;rdquo; enough to gain this coveted status: there will be a decision made sometime in the next few years. Korea remains more of a problem child. The current arms race with Germany is convenient for the coalition of army, secret police, bureaucrats, and corporate titans that effectively runs the empire: it provides a good excuse to ignore popular sentiment in favor of returning democracy to at least 1920s levels, and to label dissidents as traitors who want the terrorists to win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current Emperor is a 10 year old boy: due to his largely symbolic and ritual purpose, this does not interfere with the running of the empire. The Empire is big on atomic power, with which it hopes to become fully independent of any energy imports from outside the Asian Union for Growth and Prosperity: its cities are among the world&amp;rsquo;s largest- and most polluted, something the heavily controlled press generally fails to dwell on in its ongoing discussion of how great things are going for the greatest of empires. While women&amp;rsquo;s rights have been making progress in Germany under the influence of the Kaiserin, Japan still does its best to keep its women pregnant and in the kitchen, birth rates having declined to an extent that there is some discussion of making condoms illegal along with birth control pills. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Japan has a few allies, mostly authoritarian regimes: the Philippines, which broke away from Spain sans US interference, and allied to Japan to gain protection from other predators, is a militarized one-party state with a lot uniforms and formation marching, and flatteringly imitative of Japan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Australia and New Zealand, neutralized after the defeat of Britain, joined into a federation for mutual defense in the early 50s: although Australia has considerably developed its military since then, the international view is that if the Japanese exerted themselves, Australia-New Zealand would be pretty quickly swallowed by the Empire. Like France or Russia, Australia-New Zealand is forbidden nuclear weapons, and the Japan get _very_ pissy at any hint they might be thinking of violating neutrality by inviting in German forces. Currently, there is something of a population leakage, mostly to North America, which leads local pundits to moan and groan about how the Asians will just walk in once population decline has gone far enough. (A fair number of Asians are walking - or at least boating - in, Islamic refugees from the Japanese East Indies in particular: their extreme hostility to Japan does not prevent said pundits from claiming them to be a vanguard of the eventually Invading Hordes). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TECHNOLOGY&lt;br /&gt;Science and technology is generally a bit ahead of OTL 1969, while some fields - aerospace, cybernetics, materials science, biochemistry, and some others &amp;ndash; are substantially ahead. Japan and Germany have both put men on the Moon, and are in fact building lunar colonies &amp;ndash; armed with Moon-to-Moon missiles, as well as Moon-to-Earth. (The &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t stop a missile from the Moon&amp;rdquo; crowd of idiots is vocal in this TL, too). The USA, the British, and the Russians have put men in orbit, and there is some talk in the Confederacy of developing a manned space program. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advanced robotics and cybernetics means that the Germans and Japanese are both developing forms of combat robots, but relatively crude AI at this stage means that this means either remote control (with all sorts of methods of interfering with or even redirecting the machine&amp;rsquo;s commands) or robots with people in them &amp;ndash; a more refined version of this is powered body armor, flight capable versions of which have been developed both by the Germans and the Japanese (the Japanese version, which comes with a nifty monomolecular sword capable of cutting airplanes in half and travels underwater as well as in the air, is rather more expensive than the German one &amp;ndash; impractically expensive, in fact. The corporate conglomerate responsible for its construction fervently claims that the costs will come right down with mass production). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The Japanese are also working on Really Big atomic-powered robots. Of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also true cyborgs, a field which in which the current leaders are (openly) Texas and (secretly) France. (The French have been using up quite a few political prisoners in experimentation). Lower-level, practical applications of cybernetics in the form of advanced prostheses for the crippled are becoming practical in terms of cost in a number of countries: although this world failed to revive the Olympics as OTL, sports promoters are already quarreling about the role of partially mechanical competitors in the Sports of Tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Japanese won their war with the UK through their superior navy, and have continued to build bigger and more powerful battleships: the current generation of nuclear-powered &amp;ldquo;floating castles&amp;rdquo; are bigger and more powerful than any ship built OTL, and mount nuclear artillery. They will also be entirely useless if the ICBMs begin to fly, which is impolite to mention to a Japanese citizen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are six acknowledged nuclear powers: the US, the Confederacy, Britain, Germany, the Ottomans, and Japan. Most people suspect Texas has a nuke or two stashed away somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texas also excels in the development of rocket-propelled munitions, some fired from hand-held weapons. Most people think Texans are crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flying car is still a rarity, but the one-man &amp;ldquo;hopper&amp;rdquo; or simply &amp;ldquo;flyer&amp;rdquo; mini-helicopter is popular, both by the police and general public, with licensing for the private individual varying from almost possible in anal-retentive Germany to alarmingly easy in Texas or the Confederacy. (The military version with the sidecar is really rather silly looking). Blimps, Zeppelins, and so on are of course common: it&amp;rsquo;s an alternate universe, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SUPERHERO RACE&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the arms race, a strange new international competition is starting. &lt;br /&gt;Back in the last months of the Great War, a British biochemist stumbled across a formula to enhance human ability. It made men ten times as strong and five times as fast. It also halved their IQ and killed them in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might still have been used on a large scale out of sheer desperation, but the war shortly ended in a negotiated peace in which the French got the majority of the shaft, and the formula was consigned to low-priority animal research. It was smuggled out of the country by Confederate agents, and Confederate scientists carried out their own experiments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took half a century, but a formula that enhanced human ability without killing the subject or damaging the brain was finally developed. And the Confederate government, looking at what the so-called Ultimate Potential Serum, decided &amp;ldquo;hey! We can have superheroes to sell government policy!&amp;rdquo; (Superhero comics were doing quite well in North America at the time: probably better than OTL in the US and Confederacy). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things went pear-shaped, as they usually do in projects of this sort.&lt;br /&gt;In the end, heroes and villains died, a villain became a hero, a President was forced to embrace reform, and a &amp;ldquo;new generation&amp;rdquo; of heroes emerged: a black female &amp;ldquo;Captain Confederacy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Kid Dixie&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; who was in fact the original Captain Confederacy, minus some fifty pounds of muscle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people who developed the serum never really knew what they had. They knew it enhanced healing to the extent that nothing short of a bullet in the brain was a guaranteed kill, that it increased strength six or seven fold, speed four fold, built muscle mass&amp;hellip;but it was not what it seemed. All the _real_ change took place in the brain. Strength, speed, healing&amp;hellip;it all came from the mind, from unleashed psionic energy. The body grew muscle because the brain _believed_ super-strength must come with big ol&amp;rsquo; muscles. And new abilities developed with time &amp;ndash; the ability to read minds. The ability to visit other people in their dreams, to sense hostility, limited precognition&amp;hellip;and in the end, increased intelligence, and the ability to do away with regular injections of the superhero serum, the brain itself constantly restoring the changes previously made with the serum, and negating the otherwise lethal effects of withdrawal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitive evidence of actual super-powered Confederates of course made the leaders of a dozen foreign nations muddy their shorts, although calm was restored when it became clear that the Confederacy had no intention of going into mass production. (For one thing, rumors of the telepathy thing made superheroes more toxic than plutonium to any Confederate politician that heard them: in the dirty business of Confederate politics, way too many people had skeletons in suddenly entirely transparent closets.) Whatever the rumors might be, a dozen new research projects came into play: the British revived their old projects, the US (which had in turn stolen the original Great War formula from the Confederates some thirty years ago and quickly discarded it as impractical) ran to the old files, Deseret put more money in a related if alien line of research&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The Japanese actually had developed their own version of a propaganda superhero even before the Confederates went public with theirs. Their version, however, was cybernetically enhanced ninja assassins designed to scare the shit out of the empire&amp;rsquo;s various resistance movements, and was intended to be something discussed in scared whispers, not someone to appear on television and cheerfully address the public with a big toothy smile).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The research being difficult at best, while hundreds of spies converged on the Confederacy to try and steal the formula (if it still existed: the government claimed it had been destroyed), various military projects were repurposed as &amp;ldquo;superhero&amp;rdquo; projects: trustworthy soldiers training to use Germany&amp;rsquo;s flying powered armor project (the &amp;ldquo;Iron Falcons&amp;rdquo;) were relabeled as national Science Heroes, as was a Texan cyborg and a Mormon woman running on a terrifying array of performance-enhancing drugs: the Japanese, needing a public hero, picked the operator of their new, super-expensive, Makes The German One Look Like Crap power armor (AKA &amp;ldquo;Solar Samurai&amp;rdquo;) as their flag-bearer. Nations lacking high tech gimmicks turned to athletes and martial artists to create new national vigilantes and defenders of the people, such as California&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Spirits of the People.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Superheroes by the summer of &amp;rsquo;69 had become a gimmick, a fad, the new and exciting thing world-wide: everyone needed to have one. Russia fielded their own cyborg hero, a colossal mass of machinery which foreigners claimed was just a big robot suit. The Philippines produced costumed martial arts vigilantes. Mexico, a masked wrestler with his own camera crew. The French cyborg hero wore an all-covering costume, being too freaky looking in less enveloping duds. Italy fielded a Gladiator-themed hero whose twitchy boy sidekick was an actual natural telepath, tracked down by a government Psychic Research program which had taken twenty years to prove itself something other than a boondoggle. The US put on stage a remarkably multi-talented model/athlete/chess champion/sharpshooter/etc. with remarkable breasts. (Their _actual_ superhero program was kept behind many layers of security). The Confederation of the Andes fielded an extraordinarily fast-talking and jerkily-moving gunslinger hero who claimed to be powered by cocaine, leading to his arrest by drug enforcement agents when he incautiously decided on a trip to the USA. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in that summer, a remarkable event was to take place. The world&amp;rsquo;s first superhero convention, to be held in neutral Louisiana Free State. Not just north American heroes, but the representatives of Germany and Japan. A meeting for international peace. A meeting to show off the prowess of the various nations, technological and otherwise. Sponsored by the North American Unity Foundation, a powerful organization which lobbies for closer ties between the states of North America &amp;ndash; and has ties to important US political figures&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minor odds and ends:&lt;br /&gt;Science Fiction is called Scientifiction. There is a McDonalds but it is a taco and burrito place. There is a Sanders but he&amp;rsquo;s a Doc rather than a Colonel and sells catfish. Marihuana is a legal drug in the Confederacy. William Jennings Bryan made it to the Confederate White House and negotiated the multinational peace that established the borders of the Great Spirit Alliance, but was assassinated in 1902. Lincoln never made it to the five dollar US bill. Confederate money has a shitty exchange rate with US dollars. Havana Homicide is the most popular evening cop show in the Confederacy. The City of New York has a peculiar autonomous status within the US, making it an international Free Port with its own separate legal system &amp;ndash; and pays no taxes to Albany, State of New York.</media:description>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/yqXzFwoqDDEGi-aOQjldmSvWJNU=/fit-in/150x150/filters:no_upscale():origin()/pre00/f7d8/th/pre/f/2013/066/f/e/captainconfederacy_by_quantumbranching-d5xa8n3.png" height="91" width="150"/>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/BDeW3sencnLzpi23LUYVSOCq1xg=/fit-in/300x900/filters:no_upscale():origin()/pre00/f7d8/th/pre/f/2013/066/f/e/captainconfederacy_by_quantumbranching-d5xa8n3.png" height="183" width="300"/>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/2YJIvPlA2G_umdYqsQn8unaI3f4=/300x200/filters:fixed_height(100,100):origin()/pre00/f7d8/th/pre/f/2013/066/f/e/captainconfederacy_by_quantumbranching-d5xa8n3.png" height="183" width="300"/>            <media:content url="https://pre00.deviantart.net/f7d8/th/pre/f/2013/066/f/e/captainconfederacy_by_quantumbranching-d5xa8n3.png" height="698" width="1145" medium="image"/>            
            <description>Ok: Captain Confederacy, (the ah-comic by Will Shetterly) in 1969.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://captainconfederacy.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Confederacy&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this world, the failure of the Union to crush the Southern Rebellion was only the prologue to a long, bitter, and politically messy process of disintegration that eventually left eight new nations where there had been one in 1860. British and French intervention yielded no peace but did allow the Louisiana Free State to emerge in the territory they occupied. Texas broke with the rest of the Confederacy and took much of the southwest with it, later fishing in the muddy waters of the extended struggle between the Republican North and Imperial South of Mexico to snag some new territories. The Mormons of Deseret jumped at their chance to reestablish their independent &amp;ldquo;republic of the saints&amp;rdquo;. And so on and so forth. A rump United States eventually emerged from the Chaos Years with the reunification of the east and the mid-western states, but internal woes prevented it from pursuing further efforts at expansion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;German Unification was not butterflied away, and German size and strength and the bellicose nature of its leadership inevitable provoked defensive combinations, which in turn led to claims of &amp;ldquo;encirclement&amp;rdquo;, and due to Some Damn Fool Thing in the Balkans (albeit without Serbian complicity) provoked the outbreak of the Great War in 1910. With North America too divided against itself to send aid, even in the case of provocative German submarine warfare, and the US not rich enough to extend endless loans to the anti-German alliance, the Germans were better placed to win the war of attrition. Although in the end the French remained stubbornly non-stereotypical, refusing to surrender even after a *Michael offensive had reached Paris (which became a hell of house-to-house fighting) economic exhaustion and near-famine conditions in Britain eventually brought the two sides to the negotiating table. France lost territory and colonies, but avoided any truly crippling reparations, and managed to keep its army (even if it couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford it). In the east, German successes were more absolute: Russia collapsed into revolution, and German forces pushed far eastwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;France, feeling it had been sold down the river by its British allies (which gave up very little in the peace treaty), sunk into political turmoil. The Germans made an effort to restore a puppet Tsar to the Russian throne, but fanatical resistance by the Red Revolutionaries (not OTL Bolsheviks, but pretty ruthless chaps all the same) combined with the possibility of a French stab in the back eventually led them to accept half a loaf in the rump &amp;ldquo;Grand Duchy of St. Petersburg&amp;rdquo;, the legitimacy of which was loudly denied by both Reds and the few surviving members of the royal family which had managed to make it to exile in Russian Alaska/Alayeska (never sold to a USA with no west coast).&lt;br /&gt;Austria-Hungary eventually reached its Past Sell Date and was incorporated wholly or partially into the German Empire. The French settled down under an unpleasant left-authoritarian regime vaguely reminiscent of Baath Party Iraq, and began looking for new allies against Germany. The Japanese stumbled into China as OTL. Under the very different initial conditions, the OTL Great Depression was butterflied away, and there was a brief period of &amp;ldquo;d&amp;eacute;tente&amp;rdquo; in the later 30s and 40s: a feeble &amp;ldquo;League of Nations&amp;rdquo; was set up as an international forum, and there was some talk about peacefully resolving the mess in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, the political weather turned icy again. Violent protest and resistance against German rule in Eastern Europe brought brutal repression and a sharp turn to the right in German politics. Britain and Japan clashed for influence in Asia, leading to the outbreak of war in 1948, in which a new generation of Japanese ships and planes proved superior to anything the UK could field, and in the end the British Empire was pushed west of Ceylon. Australia and New Zealand were neutralized, and the British were kicked out of India. Japan had planned to make India a puppet, but Indian nationalists had ideas of their own, and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be Japan&amp;rsquo;s Little Brown Buddy. The Japanese, after a short war that showed them an outright conquest of India would be a pain, settled for half a loaf in the form of a Bengali satellite state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Germany developed the atom bomb in 1951, which provided a great way to intimidate uppity Russians and Frenchmen, which were threatened with incineration of their major cities if they tried to develop nuclear arsenals of their own. France, unpleasant as its government was, by the 1950s not that serious a worry, with a much weaker economy than Germany and less than 2/5 of its population. No, a new bogeyman had arrived on the global scene with the defeat of Great Britain: the Japanese Empire, whose defeat of the White Man (in British form) had made German blood boil, and whose snagging of rebellion-torn Dutch Indonesia was practically a slap to the face of the Netherlands &amp;ldquo;protector.&amp;rdquo; German politicians called for a crusade in the name of Whitey against the sinister Orientals, who fully reciprocated the heated rhetoric. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That the British should develop a bomb of their own fast enough to make German nuclear blackmail somewhat impractical was no great blow to German confidence &amp;ndash; fellow Germanics, after all &amp;ndash; but the speed at which the Japanese did the same was rather shocking. Thus began the atomic Arms Race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By 1969, both sides had enough bombs to incinerate each other twice over and the missiles to deliver them (missile and rocket technology had progressed faster than OTL: the first man on the moon - a German - planted the imperial eagle in the regolith in 1960). The whole world was increasingly being pressured to take sides, as the world&amp;rsquo;s leading powers growled at each other from either end of the Russian &amp;ldquo;buffer&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NATIONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1969, people speak of &amp;ldquo;Central North America&amp;rdquo;, the area between Canada (once again part of the British Empire after the Troubles of the 30s) and the backward nations of OTLs Central America, where the major political actors of the continent trade, quarrel, make and break alliances. Starting to the northwest, the Czars of Russia still rule in Alayeska, albeit now constrained by a Parliament. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit more populous than our Alaska, with a bit over two million inhabitants thanks to refugees from the Russian Socialist Union, economically dependent on oil and other extractive industries and militarily dependent on an alliance with the British Empire to keep the Socialists from crossing the Bering Straits and reconquering them. Not that this is a really big worry nowadays: the Union has mellowed over the last couple decades, and relationships are nowadays fairly cordial, although the Czar&amp;rsquo;s insistence in titling himself &amp;ldquo;Czar of all the Russias&amp;rdquo; still ruffles feathers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pacifica (previously the Oregon Republic, decided on a name-change after British Columbia jumped ship from Canada during the Troubles) is a prosperous social democracy, whose excellent trade relations with the Empire of Japan leads to a dispiriting degree of self-censorship in its mass media whenever the subject of Asian Atrocities comes up. The disagreeably racially and economically stratified republic of California has had a left-wing revolution and is now a People&amp;rsquo;s Republic: killings of former Oppressors of the People have been refreshingly few, although a lot of people lost their fortunes and property to the People (State). Economic difficulties and hostility from their conservative Texan and Mormon neighbors has led to an alliance of convenience with the Empire of Japan, Imperialist scumbags as they may be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texas is near anarcho-capitalistic, is a leader in high-tech, and has the highest level of gun violence in North America, which its inhabitants consider an acceptable price to pay for the right to own your own bazooka. Still a relatively small country, population-wise, Texas makes up for it with an attitude suitable for a country ten times its size. It is a perpetual annoyance to their puritanical Mormon neighbors in Deseret, a near-theocracy which has banned both alcohol and cigarettes and a level of social discipline and conformity which impresses even the Japanese. Polygamy remains legal, although nowadays sufficiently closely regulated that it&amp;rsquo;s usually only wealthy men who have multiple wives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the northern and central portions of the former US under dispute between Oregon, Deseret, the Western States of America (the US being temporarily even more fragmented than it would be in 1969), and even Canada, a number of native tribes banded together and managed to create a neutral &amp;ldquo;buffer&amp;rdquo; state between the Anglo powers. Demographically boosted by expulsions of Native Americans from elsewhere (&amp;ldquo;look, you Injuns have a homeland now. So git.&amp;rdquo;) &amp;ndash; extensive ethnic cleansing of &amp;ldquo;troublesome&amp;rdquo; tribes from Texas, the betrayal of the Civilized Tribes of *Oklahoma by their wartime Confederate allies &amp;ndash; the nation that in time became known as the &amp;ldquo;Great Spirit Alliance&amp;rdquo; survived, beat off some filibustering attempts by its neighbors, and gained international recognition. Nowadays it is the poorest country north of Mexico, and still almost as thinly populated as OTL Mongolia, but its people are free and proud and 100% enlisted in the state militia in case the white man goes on the warpath again. Currently, there is a fair degree of political turmoil as many complain that the new emigrants from Latin America (the Spirit Alliance still holds itself as a refuge for persecuted Amerindians anywhere), many of whom are Spanish-speaking Catholics, are not &amp;ldquo;proper&amp;rdquo; Indians and should not be allowed in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Texas overrunning much of the territory of their Republican opponents and continued French support, the Imperial faction remained in power in Mexico, although they demonstrate little gratitude to either. With a more stable political situation since the 1880s, Mexico is more developed than OTL 1969, and having a royal family of German descent give the country a certain respectability in the eyes of the Reich, which is useful in various ways, although Mexico is careful to avoid too close an entanglement with Germany. Louisiana Free State is neutral, French-English bilingual, a hub of trade, a center of diplomacy (Switzerland is too much in bed with the Germans nowadays to make a good neutral meeting place), and one of the best places on earth to have a good time. It&amp;rsquo;s also black-majority and works very hard to make itself useful to the Great Powers, the hot angry breath of the Confederacy always on the back of its collective neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Said Confederacy is a middling-sized power still suffering political turmoil a year after the assassination of President Lee (apparently by members of her own party) after she collected every favor she was owed to ram through the nations&amp;rsquo; first Civil Rights bill, which has held up in spite of efforts to reverse it. Black Confederates, a third of the population, still face severe discrimination, but they now have at least a chance for legal recourse, the ability to vote, and the ability to move their place of residence without getting police and government permission. And they have a hero. The Confederacy includes Cuba and Puerto Rico and the Yucatan &amp;ndash; efforts to expand its holdings into Africa were baffled by the UK navy, a conflict most Confederates prefer not to think about due to the whole &amp;ldquo;reestablishing the slave trade under another name&amp;rdquo; thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The United States remains the dominant power on the continent, the most populous, most powerful, and economically important nation, with an economy not far behind that of Germany proper if still rather smaller than the German Block considered as a whole. Many of its politicians look to the reunification of English-speaking North America, possibly even including Canada. With higher barriers to immigration from the south, it is whiter than OTL US at the time, and more social-democratic: labor is powerful, and there is more of a sense of transatlantic links with Europe. (Alliance with Germany is another idea occasionally floated by US politicians, although due to increased German authoritarianism in recent decades it does not play as well in Peoria.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Latin America is a checkerboard where the Germans and the Japanese (and to a lesser extent, the US and Britain, and the Red Russians) strive and scheme for influence. As OTL, the economies are generally fairly backwards and dominated by foreign companies, although some of the dumber Marxist ideas are absent. Brazil, where the Empire took his time to get rid of slavery, remains a monarchy, and has regional ambitions which (as it&amp;rsquo;s more intelligent politicians sourly know) will probably be baffled by Germany or Japan putting their oar in. OTLs French Guiana is German and a major base for the German space program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battered by their defeat at the hands of the Japanese, the British have withdrawn into heavily armed neutrality (on good days, its &amp;ldquo;glorious isolation.&amp;rdquo;) They still control much of Africa, but are increasingly moving away from direct rule to rule through local autonomous regimes and puppets (at least in this world they avoided lumping together such incompatible bits as north and south Nigeria or Equatoria with Muslim Sudan). Canada suffers from an increasingly noisy &amp;ldquo;Free Quebec&amp;rdquo; problem, which the British are trying to manage by working towards a Quebec still integrated through the wider empire, if not Canada specifically. The breakaway of the Boers at least allowed for an early universal democratization of the Cape Colony, and the economy is picking up again after a tough period in the 50s. The British can also boast that they have managed to maintain their democratic form of government (in spite of a few sticky spots in the late 20s and early 30s), which is more than you can say for the French.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rather nasty French regime is frustrated: its goal of avenging the humiliations of &amp;rsquo;15 seems further away than ever, now that Germany has all those nukes. Under the circumstances the general population is beginning to ask whether they really need all those secret police and so on if it&amp;rsquo;s not going to help re the Germans, which the government deals with by cranking the repression up. Forbidden from developing nukes, the French have been developing a chemical and biological arsenal of some size instead, which they feel will at least act as a deterrent when they let people know about it. They lead a small group of malcontent nations referred to as &amp;ldquo;The New Entente&amp;rdquo;, including a *fascist Italy Permanently Pissed over Venetia, a Greece very unhappy about its lack of Balkan spoils, a right-wing Spanish regime which owes its existence to French aid against their own socialist revolutionaries, and the Egyptians, whose French-derived form of government is even more pure Saddam Hussein quill than France&amp;rsquo;s (France is run by committee: Egypt, by strongman. He even has an excellent mustache). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Boer state is a Germany ally and has even worse racial issues than our South Africa at the time: a few years back some revelations about Boer plans for &amp;ldquo;population control&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;social management&amp;rdquo; were so shocking that the government was forced to loudly claim it was the work of Radical Elements, and several scapegoats fled into exile (supposedly just a hop ahead of the police, which has not been exactly energetic in seeking extradition since). Liberia, after US intervention in a local civil war, has become a US territory: Confederates cynically note that the supposedly color-blind US seems in no hurry to make it an actual state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The German Reich dominates most of Europe. It is more populous than the same area OTL 1969, having avoided the losses of WWII and attracted rather more immigration. There is some talk of maybe absorbing Switzerland and the Netherlands, but their governments are cooperative enough and their economies firmly incorporated into the German &amp;ldquo;system&amp;rdquo; running from la Manche to the Volga. Why make trouble, when there is enough of it in Eastern Europe, whose vassal German royal families often sit uneasily on their thrones, and the mellowing of the Russian Socialist Union has had the unfortunate effect of making the Ukrainians and the Cossacks less scared of the notion of striking out on their own. Antisemitism is on the rise again in these troubled times, although actual anti-Jewish legal measures so far fail to make it through the Reichstag. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Germany leads the world in theoretical science, but is hotly contested by Japan when it comes to making practical applications of its technology. The total size of the economy of the German &amp;ldquo;Block&amp;rdquo; of nations is still somewhat larger than the much more populous Japanese sphere, and standards of living are much higher: still, German romantic pessimism is quite evident in popular culture, and Germans worry a great deal about falling behind the Yellow Menace. (German popular magazines, books, movies, etc. remain highly &amp;ldquo;politically incorrect.&amp;rdquo;). At least the people have confidence in the current Kaiserin, a middle-aged &amp;ldquo;woman of iron&amp;rdquo; who can best be described as the unholy love-child of Bismark and Margaret Thatcher. (The aging former Kaiser and the German parliament did the legal work to pass the succession to the female line after a tragic zeppelin accident took out the heir presumptive and the backup kid, leaving the next three males in the line of succession an alcoholic, a lunatic and a valiant soldier who, alas, was also flamboyantly, even extravagantly gay.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ottoman Empire is a solid German ally. It is often called the Turkish Empire, given that [1] the Sultan is essentially a figurehead of the dominant political party and [2] Turkish nationalism has become a major part of said party&amp;rsquo;s ideology (it&amp;rsquo;s also the only legal party). The Arabs are understandably unhappy about this. The Ottomans are a bit annoyed about the German-Japanese rivalry, which in their opinion distracts from the more important task of destroying the Russian regime and liberating central Asia. The Monarchy is in much better shape to the east in Iran, where the Shah&amp;rsquo;s regime is modernizing with Japanese aid and savage repression of any opposition to his great power ambitions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Germany&amp;rsquo;s forward listening bases and a number of military assets are located in the Indian Federation, a somewhat politically complex union of states held together mostly by fear of the Japanese, Muslim-Hindu bickering generally staying non-violent. India is a German ally out of necessity: it needs an atom-powered protector, and the Germans are the most credible when it comes to facing down the Japanese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Russian Socialist Union was never as sociopathic as Stalin&amp;rsquo;s regime, and have mellowed since a reform faction came to power in the late 40&amp;rsquo;s, but it is still a one-party state with universal mobilization and a rather paranoid outlook, lying at it does between two hostile and nuclear-armed superpowers. Recent odd seismic activity in the Lop Nor has led various Russian officials to become surprisingly bad at understanding the German and Japanese languages and easily baffled by the simplest of questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Japanese Empire is the world&amp;rsquo;s most populous empire, and its most ruthlessly oppressive one. Its huge domains are divided into puppet regimes, colonial regimes, areas of military &amp;ldquo;special administration&amp;rdquo; (like colonies, but with more salutary massacres), and areas directly incorporated into the homeland. Taiwan, after generations of cultural re-education, is nowadays considered almost &amp;ldquo;Nipponese&amp;rdquo; enough to gain this coveted status: there will be a decision made sometime in the next few years. Korea remains more of a problem child. The current arms race with Germany is convenient for the coalition of army, secret police, bureaucrats, and corporate titans that effectively runs the empire: it provides a good excuse to ignore popular sentiment in favor of returning democracy to at least 1920s levels, and to label dissidents as traitors who want the terrorists to win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current Emperor is a 10 year old boy: due to his largely symbolic and ritual purpose, this does not interfere with the running of the empire. The Empire is big on atomic power, with which it hopes to become fully independent of any energy imports from outside the Asian Union for Growth and Prosperity: its cities are among the world&amp;rsquo;s largest- and most polluted, something the heavily controlled press generally fails to dwell on in its ongoing discussion of how great things are going for the greatest of empires. While women&amp;rsquo;s rights have been making progress in Germany under the influence of the Kaiserin, Japan still does its best to keep its women pregnant and in the kitchen, birth rates having declined to an extent that there is some discussion of making condoms illegal along with birth control pills. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Japan has a few allies, mostly authoritarian regimes: the Philippines, which broke away from Spain sans US interference, and allied to Japan to gain protection from other predators, is a militarized one-party state with a lot uniforms and formation marching, and flatteringly imitative of Japan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Australia and New Zealand, neutralized after the defeat of Britain, joined into a federation for mutual defense in the early 50s: although Australia has considerably developed its military since then, the international view is that if the Japanese exerted themselves, Australia-New Zealand would be pretty quickly swallowed by the Empire. Like France or Russia, Australia-New Zealand is forbidden nuclear weapons, and the Japan get _very_ pissy at any hint they might be thinking of violating neutrality by inviting in German forces. Currently, there is something of a population leakage, mostly to North America, which leads local pundits to moan and groan about how the Asians will just walk in once population decline has gone far enough. (A fair number of Asians are walking - or at least boating - in, Islamic refugees from the Japanese East Indies in particular: their extreme hostility to Japan does not prevent said pundits from claiming them to be a vanguard of the eventually Invading Hordes). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TECHNOLOGY&lt;br /&gt;Science and technology is generally a bit ahead of OTL 1969, while some fields - aerospace, cybernetics, materials science, biochemistry, and some others &amp;ndash; are substantially ahead. Japan and Germany have both put men on the Moon, and are in fact building lunar colonies &amp;ndash; armed with Moon-to-Moon missiles, as well as Moon-to-Earth. (The &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t stop a missile from the Moon&amp;rdquo; crowd of idiots is vocal in this TL, too). The USA, the British, and the Russians have put men in orbit, and there is some talk in the Confederacy of developing a manned space program. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advanced robotics and cybernetics means that the Germans and Japanese are both developing forms of combat robots, but relatively crude AI at this stage means that this means either remote control (with all sorts of methods of interfering with or even redirecting the machine&amp;rsquo;s commands) or robots with people in them &amp;ndash; a more refined version of this is powered body armor, flight capable versions of which have been developed both by the Germans and the Japanese (the Japanese version, which comes with a nifty monomolecular sword capable of cutting airplanes in half and travels underwater as well as in the air, is rather more expensive than the German one &amp;ndash; impractically expensive, in fact. The corporate conglomerate responsible for its construction fervently claims that the costs will come right down with mass production). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The Japanese are also working on Really Big atomic-powered robots. Of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also true cyborgs, a field which in which the current leaders are (openly) Texas and (secretly) France. (The French have been using up quite a few political prisoners in experimentation). Lower-level, practical applications of cybernetics in the form of advanced prostheses for the crippled are becoming practical in terms of cost in a number of countries: although this world failed to revive the Olympics as OTL, sports promoters are already quarreling about the role of partially mechanical competitors in the Sports of Tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Japanese won their war with the UK through their superior navy, and have continued to build bigger and more powerful battleships: the current generation of nuclear-powered &amp;ldquo;floating castles&amp;rdquo; are bigger and more powerful than any ship built OTL, and mount nuclear artillery. They will also be entirely useless if the ICBMs begin to fly, which is impolite to mention to a Japanese citizen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are six acknowledged nuclear powers: the US, the Confederacy, Britain, Germany, the Ottomans, and Japan. Most people suspect Texas has a nuke or two stashed away somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texas also excels in the development of rocket-propelled munitions, some fired from hand-held weapons. Most people think Texans are crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flying car is still a rarity, but the one-man &amp;ldquo;hopper&amp;rdquo; or simply &amp;ldquo;flyer&amp;rdquo; mini-helicopter is popular, both by the police and general public, with licensing for the private individual varying from almost possible in anal-retentive Germany to alarmingly easy in Texas or the Confederacy. (The military version with the sidecar is really rather silly looking). Blimps, Zeppelins, and so on are of course common: it&amp;rsquo;s an alternate universe, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SUPERHERO RACE&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the arms race, a strange new international competition is starting. &lt;br /&gt;Back in the last months of the Great War, a British biochemist stumbled across a formula to enhance human ability. It made men ten times as strong and five times as fast. It also halved their IQ and killed them in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might still have been used on a large scale out of sheer desperation, but the war shortly ended in a negotiated peace in which the French got the majority of the shaft, and the formula was consigned to low-priority animal research. It was smuggled out of the country by Confederate agents, and Confederate scientists carried out their own experiments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took half a century, but a formula that enhanced human ability without killing the subject or damaging the brain was finally developed. And the Confederate government, looking at what the so-called Ultimate Potential Serum, decided &amp;ldquo;hey! We can have superheroes to sell government policy!&amp;rdquo; (Superhero comics were doing quite well in North America at the time: probably better than OTL in the US and Confederacy). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things went pear-shaped, as they usually do in projects of this sort.&lt;br /&gt;In the end, heroes and villains died, a villain became a hero, a President was forced to embrace reform, and a &amp;ldquo;new generation&amp;rdquo; of heroes emerged: a black female &amp;ldquo;Captain Confederacy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Kid Dixie&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; who was in fact the original Captain Confederacy, minus some fifty pounds of muscle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people who developed the serum never really knew what they had. They knew it enhanced healing to the extent that nothing short of a bullet in the brain was a guaranteed kill, that it increased strength six or seven fold, speed four fold, built muscle mass&amp;hellip;but it was not what it seemed. All the _real_ change took place in the brain. Strength, speed, healing&amp;hellip;it all came from the mind, from unleashed psionic energy. The body grew muscle because the brain _believed_ super-strength must come with big ol&amp;rsquo; muscles. And new abilities developed with time &amp;ndash; the ability to read minds. The ability to visit other people in their dreams, to sense hostility, limited precognition&amp;hellip;and in the end, increased intelligence, and the ability to do away with regular injections of the superhero serum, the brain itself constantly restoring the changes previously made with the serum, and negating the otherwise lethal effects of withdrawal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitive evidence of actual super-powered Confederates of course made the leaders of a dozen foreign nations muddy their shorts, although calm was restored when it became clear that the Confederacy had no intention of going into mass production. (For one thing, rumors of the telepathy thing made superheroes more toxic than plutonium to any Confederate politician that heard them: in the dirty business of Confederate politics, way too many people had skeletons in suddenly entirely transparent closets.) Whatever the rumors might be, a dozen new research projects came into play: the British revived their old projects, the US (which had in turn stolen the original Great War formula from the Confederates some thirty years ago and quickly discarded it as impractical) ran to the old files, Deseret put more money in a related if alien line of research&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The Japanese actually had developed their own version of a propaganda superhero even before the Confederates went public with theirs. Their version, however, was cybernetically enhanced ninja assassins designed to scare the shit out of the empire&amp;rsquo;s various resistance movements, and was intended to be something discussed in scared whispers, not someone to appear on television and cheerfully address the public with a big toothy smile).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The research being difficult at best, while hundreds of spies converged on the Confederacy to try and steal the formula (if it still existed: the government claimed it had been destroyed), various military projects were repurposed as &amp;ldquo;superhero&amp;rdquo; projects: trustworthy soldiers training to use Germany&amp;rsquo;s flying powered armor project (the &amp;ldquo;Iron Falcons&amp;rdquo;) were relabeled as national Science Heroes, as was a Texan cyborg and a Mormon woman running on a terrifying array of performance-enhancing drugs: the Japanese, needing a public hero, picked the operator of their new, super-expensive, Makes The German One Look Like Crap power armor (AKA &amp;ldquo;Solar Samurai&amp;rdquo;) as their flag-bearer. Nations lacking high tech gimmicks turned to athletes and martial artists to create new national vigilantes and defenders of the people, such as California&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Spirits of the People.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Superheroes by the summer of &amp;rsquo;69 had become a gimmick, a fad, the new and exciting thing world-wide: everyone needed to have one. Russia fielded their own cyborg hero, a colossal mass of machinery which foreigners claimed was just a big robot suit. The Philippines produced costumed martial arts vigilantes. Mexico, a masked wrestler with his own camera crew. The French cyborg hero wore an all-covering costume, being too freaky looking in less enveloping duds. Italy fielded a Gladiator-themed hero whose twitchy boy sidekick was an actual natural telepath, tracked down by a government Psychic Research program which had taken twenty years to prove itself something other than a boondoggle. The US put on stage a remarkably multi-talented model/athlete/chess champion/sharpshooter/etc. with remarkable breasts. (Their _actual_ superhero program was kept behind many layers of security). The Confederation of the Andes fielded an extraordinarily fast-talking and jerkily-moving gunslinger hero who claimed to be powered by cocaine, leading to his arrest by drug enforcement agents when he incautiously decided on a trip to the USA. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in that summer, a remarkable event was to take place. The world&amp;rsquo;s first superhero convention, to be held in neutral Louisiana Free State. Not just north American heroes, but the representatives of Germany and Japan. A meeting for international peace. A meeting to show off the prowess of the various nations, technological and otherwise. Sponsored by the North American Unity Foundation, a powerful organization which lobbies for closer ties between the states of North America &amp;ndash; and has ties to important US political figures&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minor odds and ends:&lt;br /&gt;Science Fiction is called Scientifiction. There is a McDonalds but it is a taco and burrito place. There is a Sanders but he&amp;rsquo;s a Doc rather than a Colonel and sells catfish. Marihuana is a legal drug in the Confederacy. William Jennings Bryan made it to the Confederate White House and negotiated the multinational peace that established the borders of the Great Spirit Alliance, but was assassinated in 1902. Lincoln never made it to the five dollar US bill. Confederate money has a shitty exchange rate with US dollars. Havana Homicide is the most popular evening cop show in the Confederacy. The City of New York has a peculiar autonomous status within the US, making it an international Free Port with its own separate legal system &amp;ndash; and pays no taxes to Albany, State of New York.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://t00.deviantart.net/2YJIvPlA2G_umdYqsQn8unaI3f4=/300x200/filters:fixed_height(100,100):origin()/pre00/f7d8/th/pre/f/2013/066/f/e/captainconfederacy_by_quantumbranching-d5xa8n3.png&quot; alt=&quot;thumbnail&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>            </item>

Rhodesia was the de facto successor state to the British colony of Southern Rhodesia, which had been self-governing since achieving responsible government in 1923. A landlocked nation, Rhodesia was bordered by South Africa to the south, Bechuanaland (later Botswana) to the southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique (a Portuguese province until 1975) to the east.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhodesia&#039;s largest cities were its capital, Salisbury, and Bulawayo. The white population, which grew to nearly 300,000, dominated the country&#039;s politics and economy, though they never made up more than eight percent of the total population. Rhodesia developed an economy largely dependent on agriculture, manufacturing, and mining. Its largest exports were chrome, tobacco, and steel. International sanctions put increasing pressure on the country as time went on. The Parliament of Rhodesia, which included the lower House of Assembly and later a Senate, was predominantly white, with minority of seats reserved for blacks. After 1970, the country used a semi-presidential system, with a President, Prime Minister, and cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1953, Southern Rhodesia merged with the two other British Central African states to form the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland &amp;#8211; a loose association that placed defence and economic direction under a central government but left many domestic affairs under the control of its constituent territories. As it began to appear that decolonisation was inevitable and indigenous black populations were pressing heavily for change, the federation was dissolved in 1963.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although prepared to grant formal independence to Southern Rhodesia (now Rhodesia), the British government had adopted a policy of no independence before majority rule, dictating that colonies with a substantial population of European settlers would not receive independence except under conditions of majority rule. White Rhodesians initially balked at the suggestion; some felt they had a right to absolute political control, at least for the time being, despite their relatively small numbers. The Rhodesian authorities were also disturbed by the post-independence chaos that was plaguing other African nations at the time. However, once Rhodesia had been introduced as a topic for discussion in international bodies, extension of the status quo became a matter of concern to the world community and a serious embarrassment to the United Kingdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By 1964, growing dissatisfaction with the ongoing negotiations ousted Salisbury&#039;s incumbent Winston Field, replacing him with Ian Smith, deputy chairman of the conservative Rhodesian Front party. Smith, the colony&#039;s first Rhodesian-born leader, soon came to personify resistance to liberals in British government and those agitating for change at home. In September 1964, Smith visited Lisbon, where Portuguese prime minister Ant&amp;#243;nio de Oliveira Salazar promised him &quot;maximum support&quot; if he should declare independence. Aside from a common interest in maintaining security ties in southern Africa, Salazar expressed a great deal of anger at Britain&#039;s refusal to support Portugal when India seized Goa in 1961, admonishing Smith not to trust the British government. A Rhodesian Trade Office was opened in Lisbon in order to co-ordinate breaking the anticipated sanctions in the event of a unilateral declaration of independence later that year, which encouraged Smith not to compromise. In its turn, the Rhodesian Trade Office in Lisbon functioned as a de facto embassy and caused tension with London, which objected to Rhodesia conducting its own foreign policy. As land-locked Rhodesia bordered on the Portuguese colony of Mozambique, Salazar&#039;s promise of &quot;maximum support&quot; from Portugal in breaking the anticipated sanctions gave Smith more grounds for self-confidence in his talks with London. Smith ruled out acceptance for all five of the proposed principles as they stood, implying instead that Rhodesia was already legally entitled to independence&amp;#8212;a claim that was overwhelmingly endorsed by registered voters in a referendum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emboldened by the results of this referendum and the subsequent general election, Rhodesia now threatened to assume her own sovereignty without British consent. Harold Wilson countered by warning that such an irregular procedure would be considered treasonous, although he specifically rejected using armed force against the English &quot;kith and kin&quot; in Africa. Wilson&#039;s refusal to consider a military option encouraged Smith to proceed with his plans. Talks quickly broke down, and final efforts in October to achieve a settlement floundered; the Rhodesian Front remained unwilling to accept what were regarded as unacceptably drastic terms and the British would settle for nothing less &amp;#8211; it was a formula doomed to failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On 11 November 1965, following a brief but solemn consensus, Rhodesia&#039;s leading statesmen issued a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI). This was immediately denounced as an &quot;act of rebellion against the Crown&quot; in the United Kingdom, and Wilson promised that the illegal action would be short-lived. However, few seemed to initially realise that Rhodesia was no longer within the Commonwealth&#039;s direct sphere of influence and British rule was now a constitutional fiction; Salisbury remained virtually immune to credible metropolitan leverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On 12 October 1965, the United Nations General Assembly had noted the repeated threats of the Rhodesian authorities &quot;to declare unilaterally the independence of Southern Rhodesia, in order to perpetuate minority rule&quot;, and called upon Wilson to use all means at his disposal (including military force) to prevent the Rhodesian Front from asserting independence. After UDI was proclaimed, UN officials branded Ian Smith&#039;s government as an &quot;illegal racist minority regime&quot; and called on member states to sever economic ties with Rhodesia, recommending sanctions on petroleum products and military hardware. In December 1966, these measures became mandatory, extending to bar the purchase of Rhodesian tobacco, chrome, copper, asbestos, sugar, meat, and hides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UK, having already adopted extensive sanctions of its own, dispatched a Royal Navy squadron to monitor oil deliveries in the port of Beira in Mozambique, from which a strategic pipeline ran to Umtali in Rhodesia. The warships were to deter &quot;by force, if necessary, vessels reasonably believed to be carrying oil destined for (Southern) Rhodesia&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some nations, such as Switzerland, and West Germany, which were not UN members, conducted business legally with Rhodesia &amp;#8211; the latter remained the Smith government&#039;s largest trading partner in Western Europe until 1973, when Bonn joined the UN. Japan continued to accept more Rhodesian exports than any other nation, and Iran provided oil. The Portuguese government marketed Rhodesian products as its own, via false certificates of origin and disguised trade channels. South Africa openly refused to observe the UN sanctions. A 1971 amendment passed in the United States permitted American firms to go on importing Rhodesian chromium and nickel as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the poor showing of sanctions, Rhodesia found it nearly impossible to obtain diplomatic recognition abroad. In 1970, the US government had made it clear that the UDI would not be recognised &quot;under [any] circumstances&quot;. Even the National Party government in South Africa, although sympathetic, did not recognise Rhodesia as an independent state, maintaining only an Accredited Diplomatic Representative in Salisbury. This allowed Pretoria to continue to recognise British sovereignty as well as to deal with the de facto authority of the Smith government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, the state retained its pledged loyalty to Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, recognising her as Queen of Rhodesia. When Smith and Deputy Prime Minister Clifford Dupont called on colonial Governor Sir Humphrey Gibbs to formally notify him of the UDI, Gibbs condemned the UDI as an act of treason. After Smith formally announced the UDI on the radio, Gibbs used his reserve power to dismiss Smith and his entire cabinet from office on orders from Whitehall. However, Gibbs was unable to enact any concrete actions to foster a return to legality. Government ministers simply ignored his notices, contending that UDI made his office obsolete. Even so, Gibbs continued to occupy his residence in Salisbury until 1970, when he vacated the premises and left Rhodesia following the declaration of a republic. He had effectively been superseded before then; the Smith government stated that if the Queen did not appoint a Governor-General, it would name Dupont as &quot;Officer Administering the Government&quot;. Smith had intended to have Dupont named Governor-General, but Elizabeth would not even consider this advice. With few exceptions, the international community backed Whitehall&#039;s assertion that Gibbs was the Queen&#039;s only legitimate representative, and hence the only lawful authority in what it still maintained was Southern Rhodesia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In September 1968, the Appellate Division of the Rhodesian High Court ruled that Ian Smith&#039;s administration had become the de jure government of the country, not merely the de facto one. To support his decision, Chief Justice Sir Hugh Beadle used several statements made by Hugo Grotius, who maintained that there was no way that a nation could rightly claim to be governing a particular territory &amp;#8211; if it was waging a war against that territory. Beadle argued that due to Britain&#039;s economic war against Rhodesia, she could not (at the same point) be described as governing Rhodesia. Resulting court decisions held that the Smith government &quot;could lawfully do anything its predecessors could lawfully have done&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Salisbury commission chaired by prominent lawyer W.R. Waley was appointed to study constitutional options open to the Rhodesian authorities as of April 1968, but reaching a further settlement with the British was ruled out early on. Waley, although insistent that &quot;Europeans must surrender any belief in permanent European domination&quot;, also testified that majority rule was not desirable immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talks aimed at easing the differences between Rhodesia and the United Kingdom were carried out aboard Royal Navy vessels once in December 1966 and again in October 1968. Both efforts failed to achieve agreement, although Harold Wilson added a sixth principle to the five he had previously enunciated: &quot;it would be necessary to ensure that, regardless of race, there was no oppression of the majority by the minority or of [any] minority by the majority.&quot; Rhodesian resolve stiffened following a failure to reach a new settlement, with more radical elements of the Rhodesian Front calling for a republican constitution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During a two-proposition referendum held in 1969, the proposal for severing all remaining ties to the British Crown passed by a majority of 61,130 votes to 14,327. Rhodesia declared itself a republic on 2 March 1970. Under the new constitution, a president served as ceremonial head of state, with the prime minister nominally reporting to him. Some in Rhodesian government had hoped in vain that the declaration of a republic would finally prompt other nations to grant recognition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The years following Rhodesia&#039;s UDI saw an unfolding series of economic, military, and political pressures placed on the country that eventually brought about majority rule, a totality of these factors rather than any one the reason for introducing change. In 2005, a conference at the London School of Economics that discussed Rhodesia&#039;s independence concluded that UDI was sparked by an existing racial conflict complicated by Cold War intrigues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At large, the European population&#039;s emerging attitude to UDI was tense. Many white Rhodesians had seen themselves as nothing less than fully fledged members of the British Empire, carrying on the same rugged values and frontier spirit of the early Englishmen who had settled in 1890. But such confidence was rudely shaken by Whitehall&#039;s refusal to grant independence on their terms. After 1965, there were those who continued to claim that they were collectively upholders of principle and defenders of such values against the twin threats of communism, manifested through the militant black nationalists, and &amp;#8211; ironically &amp;#8211; the decadence of Britain herself. Often repeated appeals to the Christian heritage of their pioneer ancestors in &quot;defending the free world&quot; reflected these beliefs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Rhodesian exports were generally competitive and had previously been entitled to preferential treatment on the British market, the former colony did not recognise the need for escalating the pace of diversification before independence. Following the UDI, however, Rhodesia began to demonstrate that it had the potential to develop a greater degree of economic self-sufficiency. After the Rhodesian Front began introducing incentives accorded to domestic production, industrial output expanded dramatically. A rigid system of countermeasures enacted to combat sanctions succeeded in blunting their impact for at least a decade. Over the next nine years Rhodesian companies, spiting the freezing of their assets and blocking of overseas accounts, also perfected cunning techniques of sanctions evasion through both local and foreign subsidiaries, which operated on a clandestine trade network.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From 1968 until 1970, there was virtually no further dialogue between Rhodesia and the UK. In a referendum in 1969, white voters approved a new constitution and the establishment of a republic, thereby severing Rhodesia&#039;s last links with the British Crown, duly declared in March 1970. This changed immediately after the election of Edward Heath, who reopened negotiations. In November 1971, Douglas-Home renewed contacts with Salisbury and announced a proposed agreement that would be satisfactory to both sides &amp;#8211; it recognised Rhodesia&#039;s 1969 constitution as the legal frame of government, while agreeing that gradual legislative representation was an acceptable formula for unhindered advance to majority rule. Nevertheless, the new settlement, if approved, would also implement an immediate improvement in black political status, offer a means to terminate racial discrimination, and provide a solid guarantee against retrogressive constitutional amendments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As early as 1960, minority rule in Southern Rhodesia was already being challenged by a rising tide of political violence led by African nationalists such as Joshua Nkomo and Ndabaningi Sithole. After their public campaigns were initially suppressed, many believed that negotiation was completely incapable of meeting their aspirations. Petrol bombings by radicals became increasingly common. It was officially noted that between January and September 1962 alone, 33 bombings were carried out, in addition to 27 acts of attempted sabotage on communications. In that same period, nationalists were implicated in arson targeting 18 schools and 10 churches. Nkomo&#039;s Zimbabwe African People&#039;s Union (ZAPU) subsequently disclosed that it had formed a military wing, the Zimbabwe People&#039;s Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA), and &#039;the decision to start bringing in arms and ammunition and to send young men away for sabotage training&#039; had already been made. The Rhodesian authorities responded by banning ZAPU and driving its supporters underground. Frustrated by their repeated failures, nationalists also conducted a campaign of terror against black Africans, murdering those who had either identified with the colonial administration or had simply failed to demonstrate their allegiance to the cause. To protect civilians, emergency laws were imposed, broadening the legal definition of unlawful gatherings and giving the police greater powers to crack down on agitators or subversives. The death sentence was also introduced for terrorism involving explosives and arson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A crisis of confidence soon resulted across ZAPU, which was already suffering from poor morale, compounded by tribal and ideological factionalism. In 1963, party dissidents rejected Joshua Nkomo&#039;s authority and formed their own organisation, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) &amp;#8211; which worked out its own strategy for impressing international opinion, undermining white assurance, and achieving a complete breakdown of order. By August 1964, ZANU was banned by the Rhodesian government as well, which cited widespread intimidation by that party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ZANU&#039;s agenda was inward-looking, leftist, and pan-Africanist in nature. After being forced from Rhodesia, they continued to operate in exile, creating occupation groups representing urban workers, miners, and peasant farmers. ZANU also attracted professionals, students, and feminists to its ranks. While ZAPU theoretically continued to command the allegiance of most Ndebele and Shona activists, Sithole and Mugabe drew their support base from the rural peasantry in the Mashonaland countryside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the UDI, ZANU officials mapped an elaborate plan for the &quot;liberation of Zimbabwe&quot; which called for attacks on white farmers, destruction of cash crops, disrupting electricity in urban areas, and petrol bombings. They also formed an armed wing of their own, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sithole and Nkomo both insisted on the need for armed struggle, but disagreed on the means to go about it. For example, ZIPRA tended to follow Soviet thinking, placing an emphasis on sophisticated weaponry in the hopes of winning a conventional battle like the Viet Minh at Dien Bien Phu. ZANLA militants preferred to politicise populations in areas which they intended to seize. Neither force, however, had acquired basic knowledge of guerrilla warfare. Debate on political theory and insurgent tactics became the obsession of nationalists at this stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In April 1966, two ZANLA units, having received prior training at Nanjing Military College, crossed into Rhodesia from Zambia. They were armed with SKS carbines, hand grenades, explosives, and communist pamphlets, having been issued vague instructions to sabotage important installations before killing white persons indiscriminately. At least five guerrillas were simply arrested before getting very far. Another seven hoped to destroy a pylon carrying electricity to Sinoia in the northwest. Their faulty demolitions were uncovered by the Rhodesian Security Forces and the men easily tracked to a nearby ranch on 28 April, where they were shot resisting capture. This event is considered to have been the first engagement of what came to be known as the &quot;Bush War&quot; in Rhodesia and the &quot;Second Chimurenga&quot; (or rebellion in Shona) by supporters of the guerrillas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The campaign proper is generally considered to have started in 1972 with the Attack on Altena Farm, despite the minor threat already represented by the nationalist movements in the 1960s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After unsuccessful appeals to Britain and the United States for military assistance, Robert Mugabe, who was based in Mozambique after that country&#039;s independence from Portugal in 1975, led ZANU to seek support from the People&#039;s Republic of China and countries of the Soviet Bloc. Joshua Nkomo, based in Zambia and also supported by the Soviet Union, led ZAPU. ZANU and ZAPU together formed &#039;the Patriotic Front&#039;. Broadly, ZANLA recruited mainly from Mashonaland and Manicaland provinces, whilst the ZIPRA recruited from Mashonaland West, Midlands and Matabeleland provinces of Zimbabwe. As Mugabe had described himself in an interview as a &quot;Marxist-Leninist of Maoist Thought&quot;, which enraged the Kremlin, Soviet support went exclusively to ZAPU while China supported ZANU. Soviet arms went to the ZAPU via Zambia and Mozambique, and Nkomo was in regular contact with Vasili Grigoryevich Solodovnikov, the Soviet ambassador to Zambia who was also known to be associated with the KGB. Nkomo, who depended heavily on Soviet arms, had what he called an &quot;extensive correspondence&quot; with Yuri Andropov, the KGB chief, while officers from the Cuban DGI provided training for the ZAPU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the collapse of Portuguese rule in Mozambique in 1974&amp;#8211;75, it was no longer viable for the Smith regime to sustain white minority rule indefinitely. By this time, even South Africa&#039;s Vorster had come to this view. While Vorster was unwilling to make concessions to his own country&#039;s blacks, he concluded that white minority rule was not sustainable in a country where blacks outnumbered whites 22:1. In 1978, there were 270,000 Rhodesians of European descent and more than six million Africans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;International business groups involved in the country (e.g. Lonrho) transferred their support from the Rhodesian government to black nationalist parties. Business leaders and politicians feted Nkomo on his visits to Europe. ZANU also attracted business supporters who saw the course that future events were likely to take. Funding and arms support provided by supporters, particularly from the Soviet Union and its allies in the latter 1970s, allowed both ZIPRA and the ZANLA to acquire more sophisticated weaponry, thereby increasing the military pressure that the guerrillas were able to place on Rhodesia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until 1972, containing the guerrillas was little more than a police action. Even as late as August 1975 when Rhodesian government and black nationalist leaders met at Victoria Falls for negotiations brokered by South Africa and Zambia, the talks never got beyond the procedural phase. Rhodesian representatives made it clear they were prepared to fight an all out war to prevent majority rule. However, the situation changed dramatically after the end of Portuguese colonial rule in Mozambique in 1975. Rhodesia now found itself almost entirely surrounded by hostile states and even South Africa, its only real ally, pressed for a settlement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, ZANU&#039;s alliance with FRELIMO (the Liberation Front of Mozambique) and the porous border between Mozambique and eastern Rhodesia enabled large-scale training and infiltration of ZANU/ZANLA fighters. The governments of Zambia and Botswana were also emboldened sufficiently to allow resistance movement bases to be set up in their territories. Guerrillas began to launch operations deep inside Rhodesia, attacking roads, railways, economic targets and isolated security force positions, in 1976.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The government adopted a &#039;strategic hamlets&#039; policy of the kind used in Malaya and Vietnam to restrict the influence of insurgents over the population of rural areas. Local people were forced to relocate to protected villages (PVs) which were strictly controlled and guarded by the government against rebel atrocities. The protected villages were compared by the guerrillas to concentration camps. Some contemporary accounts claim that this interference in the lives of local residents induced many of them who had previously been neutral to support the guerrillas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A major problem for the Rhodesian state in fighting the Bush War was always a shortage of manpower. Of the 3,000 white men liable for conscription in 1973, only about 1,000 reported when called-up. In February 1978, the Rhodesian Army stated it needed a minimum of 1,041 men to continue combat operations, and of those called up, only 570 reported for duty while the rest chose to move to South Africa. The Rhodesian Army consistently out-fought the ZANU and ZAPU guerillas. However, white emigration caused a shortage of military manpower. White emigration increased as the state called up more and more men to fight in the war, creating a vicious circle, which gradually limited the capacity of the Rhodesian state to continue the war. In order to stop white emigration, the Smith government brought in a law in 1975 forbidding Rhodesian citizens from holding foreign currency, but the law was widely flouted. In order to encourage white emigration, the guerrillas of ZANU and ZAPU followed a strategy of attacking anything and everything that was of economic value across the country in order to force the state to call up more men, and of killing white civilians. Killing Rhodesian white citizens tended to have an &quot;echo effect&quot; as the ZANU and ZAPU had both estimated that for 1 white citizen killed, it caused about 20 to leave Rhodesia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhodesia began to lose vital economic and military support from South Africa, which, while sympathetic to the white minority government, never accorded it diplomatic recognition. The South African government placed limits on the fuel and munitions they supplied to the Rhodesian military. They also withdrew the personnel and equipment that they had previously provided to aid the war effort, though covert military support continued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1976, the South African government and United States governments worked together to place pressure on Smith to agree to a form of majority rule. In response to the initiative of US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, in 1976 Ian Smith accepted the principle of black majority rule within two years. The Rhodesians now offered more concessions, but those concessions, focused on reaching an &quot;internal settlement&quot; with moderate black leaders, were insufficient to end the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time, some Rhodesians said the still embittered history between the British-dominated Rhodesia and the Afrikaner-dominated South Africa partly led the South African government to withdraw its aid to Rhodesia. Ian Smith said in his memoirs that even though many white South Africans supported Rhodesia, South African Prime Minister John Vorster&#039;s policy of d&amp;#233;tente with the Black African states ended up with Rhodesia being offered as the &quot;sacrificial lamb&quot; to buy more time for South Africa. Other observers perceived South Africa&#039;s distancing itself from Rhodesia as being an early move in the process that led to majority rule in South Africa itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the latter 1970s, the militants had successfully put the economy of Rhodesia under significant pressure while the numbers of guerrillas in the country were steadily increasing. The government abandoned its early strategy of trying to defend the borders in favour of trying to defend key economic areas and lines of communication with South Africa, while the rest of the countryside became a patchwork of &quot;no-go areas&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the late 1970s, Rhodesia&#039;s front-line forces contained about 25,000 regular troops and police &amp;#8211; backed up by relatively strong army and police reserves. Its mechanised contingent consisted of light armoured cars and improvised mine-protected armoured personnel carriers, complemented by eight tanks (Polish built T-55LD tanks), delivered in the last year of the war. The Rhodesian Air Force operated an assortment of both Canberra light bombers, Hawker Hunter fighter bombers, older de Havilland Vampire jets as well as a somewhat antiquated, but still potent, helicopter arm. These forces, including highly trained special operations units, were capable of launching devastating raids on resistance movement camps outside the country, as in Operation Dingo in 1977 and other similar operations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, guerrilla pressure inside the country itself was steadily increasing in the latter 1970s. By 1978&amp;#8211;79, the war had become a contest between the guerrilla warfare placing ever increasing pressure on the Rhodesian regime and civil population, and the Rhodesian government&#039;s strategy of trying to hold off the militants until external recognition for a compromise political settlement with moderate black leaders could be secured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By this time, the need to cut a deal was apparent to most Rhodesians, but not to all. Ian Smith had dismissed his intransigent Defence Minister, P. K. van der Byl, as early as 1976. Van der Byl was a hard-line opponent of any form of compromise with domestic opposition or the international community since before UDI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shooting down on 3 September 1978 of the civilian Vickers Viscount airliner Hunyani, Air Rhodesia Flight RH825, in the Kariba area by ZIPRA fighters using a surface-to-air missile, with the subsequent massacre of its survivors, is widely considered to be the event that finally destroyed the Rhodesians&#039; will to continue the war. Although militarily insignificant, the loss of this aircraft (and a second Viscount, the Umniati, in 1979) demonstrated the reach of resistance movements extended to Rhodesian civil society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rhodesians&#039; means to continue the war were also eroding fast. In December 1978, a ZANLA unit penetrated the outskirts of Salisbury and fired a volley of rockets and incendiary device rounds into the main oil storage depot &amp;#8211; the most heavily defended economic asset in the country. The storage tanks burned for five days, giving off a column of smoke that could be seen 130 kilometres away. Five hundred thousand barrels (79,000 m3) of petroleum product (comprising Rhodesia&#039;s strategic oil reserve) were lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rhodesian army continued its &quot;mobile counter-offensive&quot; strategy of holding key positions (&quot;vital asset ground&quot;) while carrying out raids into the no-go areas and into neighbouring countries. While often extraordinarily successful in inflicting heavy guerrilla casualties, such raids also on occasion failed to achieve their objectives. In April 1979 special forces carried out a raid on Joshua Nkomo&#039;s residence in Lusaka (Zambia) with the stated intention of assassinating him. Nkomo and his family left hastily a few hours before the raid &amp;#8211; having clearly been warned that the raid was coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1979, some special forces units were accused of using counterinsurgent operations as cover for ivory poaching and smuggling. Colonel Reid-Daly (commander of the Selous Scouts) discovered that his phone was bugged and after challenging a superior officer on this issue was court martialled for insubordination. He received the lightest sentence possible, a caution, but he continued to fight his conviction and eventually resigned his commission and left the Army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the result of an Internal Settlement signed on 3 March 1978 between the Rhodesian government and the moderate African nationalist parties, which were not in exile and not involved in the war, elections were held in April 1979. The United African National Council (UANC) party won a majority in this election, and its leader, Abel Muzorewa (a United Methodist Church bishop), became the country&#039;s first black prime minister on 1 June 1979. The country&#039;s name was changed to Zimbabwe Rhodesia. The internal settlement left control of the country&#039;s police, security forces, civil service and judiciary in white hands, for the moment. It assured whites of about one third of the seats in parliament. It was essentially a power-sharing arrangement between whites and blacks which, in the eyes of many, particularly the insurgents, did not amount to majority rule. However, the United States Senate voted to end economic sanctions against Zimbabwe Rhodesia on 12 June.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the 1979 election was described by the Rhodesian government as non-racial and democratic, it did not include the main nationalist parties ZANU and ZAPU. In spite of offers from Ian Smith, the latter parties declined to participate in an election in which their political position would be insecure and under a proposed constitution which they had played no part in drafting and which was perceived as retaining strong white minority privilege.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bishop Muzorewa&#039;s government did not receive international recognition. The Bush War continued unabated and sanctions were not lifted. The international community refused to accept the validity of any agreement which did not incorporate the main nationalist parties. The British Government (then led by the recently elected Margaret Thatcher) issued invitations to all parties to attend a peace conference at Lancaster House. These negotiations took place in London in late 1979. The three-month-long conference almost failed to reach conclusion, due to disagreements on land reform, but resulted in the Lancaster House Agreement. UDI ended, and Rhodesia temporarily reverted to the status of a British colony (the &#039;Colony of Southern Rhodesia&#039;). As per the agreement, Lord Soames became Governor with full legislative and executive powers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lancaster House Agreement further provided for a ceasefire which was followed by an internationally supervised general election, held on February 1980. ZANU led by Robert Mugabe won this election, some alleged, by terrorising its political opposition, including supporters of ZAPU, through former insurgents that had not confined themselves to the designated guerrilla assembly points, as stipulated by the Lancaster House Agreement. The observers and Soames were accused of looking the other way, and Mugabe&#039;s victory was certified. Nevertheless, few could doubt that Mugabe&#039;s support within his majority Shona tribal group was extremely strong. The Rhodesian military seriously considered mounting a coup against a perceived stolen election (&quot;Operation Quartz&quot;) to prevent ZANU from taking over the country. The alleged coup was to include the assassination of Mugabe and coordinated assaults on guerrilla assembly points throughout the country. The plan was eventually scuttled, as it was obvious that Mugabe enjoyed widespread support from the black majority despite voter intimidation, as well as the fact that the coup would gain no external support, and a conflagration which would engulf the country was seen as inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mugabe and the victorious black nationalists were rather less concerned by Operation Quartz than by the possibility that there might be a mass exodus of the white community of the kind that had caused chaos in Mozambique five years earlier. Such an exodus had been prepared for by the South African government. With the agreement of the British Governor of Rhodesia, South African troops had entered the country to secure the road approaches to the Beit Bridge border crossing point. Refugee camps had been prepared in the Transvaal. On the day the election results became known, most white families had prepared contingency plans for flight, including the packing of cars and suitcases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after a meeting with Robert Mugabe and the central committee of ZANU (PF), Ian Smith was reassured that whites could and should stay in the new Zimbabwe. Mugabe promised that he would abide strictly by the terms of the Lancaster House Agreement and that changes in Zimbabwe would be made gradually and by a proper legal process. Mugabe, however, would reverse his commitment to these agreements some years later; the regime began confiscating white-owned farmlands. This is widely blamed for leading to the deterioration of the Zimbabwean economy, which plagues the country today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On 18 April 1980 the country became independent within the Commonwealth of Nations as the Republic of Zimbabwe, and its capital, Salisbury, was renamed Harare two years later.</media:description>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/PSi83kaM4mM-K8sIZsWugOIvs0E=/fit-in/150x150/filters:no_upscale():origin()/pre00/3b85/th/pre/f/2018/290/0/4/republic_of_rhodesia_by_gregi989-dcpnlab.png" height="75" width="150"/>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/HM89QKEGIHwTlJMXbLIhSvCd-Rs=/fit-in/300x900/filters:no_upscale():origin()/pre00/3b85/th/pre/f/2018/290/0/4/republic_of_rhodesia_by_gregi989-dcpnlab.png" height="150" width="300"/>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/Pd8NzgX1tsaPy3qRnqMbCuFcokA=/300x200/filters:fixed_height(100,100):origin()/pre00/3b85/th/pre/f/2018/290/0/4/republic_of_rhodesia_by_gregi989-dcpnlab.png" height="150" width="300"/>            <media:content url="https://pre00.deviantart.net/3b85/th/pre/f/2018/290/0/4/republic_of_rhodesia_by_gregi989-dcpnlab.png" height="632" width="1264" medium="image"/>

Rhodesia was the de facto successor state to the British colony of Southern Rhodesia, which had been self-governing since achieving responsible government in 1923. A landlocked nation, Rhodesia was bordered by South Africa to the south, Bechuanaland (later Botswana) to the southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique (a Portuguese province until 1975) to the east.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhodesia&#039;s largest cities were its capital, Salisbury, and Bulawayo. The white population, which grew to nearly 300,000, dominated the country&#039;s politics and economy, though they never made up more than eight percent of the total population. Rhodesia developed an economy largely dependent on agriculture, manufacturing, and mining. Its largest exports were chrome, tobacco, and steel. International sanctions put increasing pressure on the country as time went on. The Parliament of Rhodesia, which included the lower House of Assembly and later a Senate, was predominantly white, with minority of seats reserved for blacks. After 1970, the country used a semi-presidential system, with a President, Prime Minister, and cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1953, Southern Rhodesia merged with the two other British Central African states to form the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland &amp;#8211; a loose association that placed defence and economic direction under a central government but left many domestic affairs under the control of its constituent territories. As it began to appear that decolonisation was inevitable and indigenous black populations were pressing heavily for change, the federation was dissolved in 1963.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although prepared to grant formal independence to Southern Rhodesia (now Rhodesia), the British government had adopted a policy of no independence before majority rule, dictating that colonies with a substantial population of European settlers would not receive independence except under conditions of majority rule. White Rhodesians initially balked at the suggestion; some felt they had a right to absolute political control, at least for the time being, despite their relatively small numbers. The Rhodesian authorities were also disturbed by the post-independence chaos that was plaguing other African nations at the time. However, once Rhodesia had been introduced as a topic for discussion in international bodies, extension of the status quo became a matter of concern to the world community and a serious embarrassment to the United Kingdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By 1964, growing dissatisfaction with the ongoing negotiations ousted Salisbury&#039;s incumbent Winston Field, replacing him with Ian Smith, deputy chairman of the conservative Rhodesian Front party. Smith, the colony&#039;s first Rhodesian-born leader, soon came to personify resistance to liberals in British government and those agitating for change at home. In September 1964, Smith visited Lisbon, where Portuguese prime minister Ant&amp;#243;nio de Oliveira Salazar promised him &quot;maximum support&quot; if he should declare independence. Aside from a common interest in maintaining security ties in southern Africa, Salazar expressed a great deal of anger at Britain&#039;s refusal to support Portugal when India seized Goa in 1961, admonishing Smith not to trust the British government. A Rhodesian Trade Office was opened in Lisbon in order to co-ordinate breaking the anticipated sanctions in the event of a unilateral declaration of independence later that year, which encouraged Smith not to compromise. In its turn, the Rhodesian Trade Office in Lisbon functioned as a de facto embassy and caused tension with London, which objected to Rhodesia conducting its own foreign policy. As land-locked Rhodesia bordered on the Portuguese colony of Mozambique, Salazar&#039;s promise of &quot;maximum support&quot; from Portugal in breaking the anticipated sanctions gave Smith more grounds for self-confidence in his talks with London. Smith ruled out acceptance for all five of the proposed principles as they stood, implying instead that Rhodesia was already legally entitled to independence&amp;#8212;a claim that was overwhelmingly endorsed by registered voters in a referendum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emboldened by the results of this referendum and the subsequent general election, Rhodesia now threatened to assume her own sovereignty without British consent. Harold Wilson countered by warning that such an irregular procedure would be considered treasonous, although he specifically rejected using armed force against the English &quot;kith and kin&quot; in Africa. Wilson&#039;s refusal to consider a military option encouraged Smith to proceed with his plans. Talks quickly broke down, and final efforts in October to achieve a settlement floundered; the Rhodesian Front remained unwilling to accept what were regarded as unacceptably drastic terms and the British would settle for nothing less &amp;#8211; it was a formula doomed to failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On 11 November 1965, following a brief but solemn consensus, Rhodesia&#039;s leading statesmen issued a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI). This was immediately denounced as an &quot;act of rebellion against the Crown&quot; in the United Kingdom, and Wilson promised that the illegal action would be short-lived. However, few seemed to initially realise that Rhodesia was no longer within the Commonwealth&#039;s direct sphere of influence and British rule was now a constitutional fiction; Salisbury remained virtually immune to credible metropolitan leverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On 12 October 1965, the United Nations General Assembly had noted the repeated threats of the Rhodesian authorities &quot;to declare unilaterally the independence of Southern Rhodesia, in order to perpetuate minority rule&quot;, and called upon Wilson to use all means at his disposal (including military force) to prevent the Rhodesian Front from asserting independence. After UDI was proclaimed, UN officials branded Ian Smith&#039;s government as an &quot;illegal racist minority regime&quot; and called on member states to sever economic ties with Rhodesia, recommending sanctions on petroleum products and military hardware. In December 1966, these measures became mandatory, extending to bar the purchase of Rhodesian tobacco, chrome, copper, asbestos, sugar, meat, and hides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UK, having already adopted extensive sanctions of its own, dispatched a Royal Navy squadron to monitor oil deliveries in the port of Beira in Mozambique, from which a strategic pipeline ran to Umtali in Rhodesia. The warships were to deter &quot;by force, if necessary, vessels reasonably believed to be carrying oil destined for (Southern) Rhodesia&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some nations, such as Switzerland, and West Germany, which were not UN members, conducted business legally with Rhodesia &amp;#8211; the latter remained the Smith government&#039;s largest trading partner in Western Europe until 1973, when Bonn joined the UN. Japan continued to accept more Rhodesian exports than any other nation, and Iran provided oil. The Portuguese government marketed Rhodesian products as its own, via false certificates of origin and disguised trade channels. South Africa openly refused to observe the UN sanctions. A 1971 amendment passed in the United States permitted American firms to go on importing Rhodesian chromium and nickel as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the poor showing of sanctions, Rhodesia found it nearly impossible to obtain diplomatic recognition abroad. In 1970, the US government had made it clear that the UDI would not be recognised &quot;under [any] circumstances&quot;. Even the National Party government in South Africa, although sympathetic, did not recognise Rhodesia as an independent state, maintaining only an Accredited Diplomatic Representative in Salisbury. This allowed Pretoria to continue to recognise British sovereignty as well as to deal with the de facto authority of the Smith government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, the state retained its pledged loyalty to Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, recognising her as Queen of Rhodesia. When Smith and Deputy Prime Minister Clifford Dupont called on colonial Governor Sir Humphrey Gibbs to formally notify him of the UDI, Gibbs condemned the UDI as an act of treason. After Smith formally announced the UDI on the radio, Gibbs used his reserve power to dismiss Smith and his entire cabinet from office on orders from Whitehall. However, Gibbs was unable to enact any concrete actions to foster a return to legality. Government ministers simply ignored his notices, contending that UDI made his office obsolete. Even so, Gibbs continued to occupy his residence in Salisbury until 1970, when he vacated the premises and left Rhodesia following the declaration of a republic. He had effectively been superseded before then; the Smith government stated that if the Queen did not appoint a Governor-General, it would name Dupont as &quot;Officer Administering the Government&quot;. Smith had intended to have Dupont named Governor-General, but Elizabeth would not even consider this advice. With few exceptions, the international community backed Whitehall&#039;s assertion that Gibbs was the Queen&#039;s only legitimate representative, and hence the only lawful authority in what it still maintained was Southern Rhodesia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In September 1968, the Appellate Division of the Rhodesian High Court ruled that Ian Smith&#039;s administration had become the de jure government of the country, not merely the de facto one. To support his decision, Chief Justice Sir Hugh Beadle used several statements made by Hugo Grotius, who maintained that there was no way that a nation could rightly claim to be governing a particular territory &amp;#8211; if it was waging a war against that territory. Beadle argued that due to Britain&#039;s economic war against Rhodesia, she could not (at the same point) be described as governing Rhodesia. Resulting court decisions held that the Smith government &quot;could lawfully do anything its predecessors could lawfully have done&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Salisbury commission chaired by prominent lawyer W.R. Waley was appointed to study constitutional options open to the Rhodesian authorities as of April 1968, but reaching a further settlement with the British was ruled out early on. Waley, although insistent that &quot;Europeans must surrender any belief in permanent European domination&quot;, also testified that majority rule was not desirable immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talks aimed at easing the differences between Rhodesia and the United Kingdom were carried out aboard Royal Navy vessels once in December 1966 and again in October 1968. Both efforts failed to achieve agreement, although Harold Wilson added a sixth principle to the five he had previously enunciated: &quot;it would be necessary to ensure that, regardless of race, there was no oppression of the majority by the minority or of [any] minority by the majority.&quot; Rhodesian resolve stiffened following a failure to reach a new settlement, with more radical elements of the Rhodesian Front calling for a republican constitution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During a two-proposition referendum held in 1969, the proposal for severing all remaining ties to the British Crown passed by a majority of 61,130 votes to 14,327. Rhodesia declared itself a republic on 2 March 1970. Under the new constitution, a president served as ceremonial head of state, with the prime minister nominally reporting to him. Some in Rhodesian government had hoped in vain that the declaration of a republic would finally prompt other nations to grant recognition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The years following Rhodesia&#039;s UDI saw an unfolding series of economic, military, and political pressures placed on the country that eventually brought about majority rule, a totality of these factors rather than any one the reason for introducing change. In 2005, a conference at the London School of Economics that discussed Rhodesia&#039;s independence concluded that UDI was sparked by an existing racial conflict complicated by Cold War intrigues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At large, the European population&#039;s emerging attitude to UDI was tense. Many white Rhodesians had seen themselves as nothing less than fully fledged members of the British Empire, carrying on the same rugged values and frontier spirit of the early Englishmen who had settled in 1890. But such confidence was rudely shaken by Whitehall&#039;s refusal to grant independence on their terms. After 1965, there were those who continued to claim that they were collectively upholders of principle and defenders of such values against the twin threats of communism, manifested through the militant black nationalists, and &amp;#8211; ironically &amp;#8211; the decadence of Britain herself. Often repeated appeals to the Christian heritage of their pioneer ancestors in &quot;defending the free world&quot; reflected these beliefs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Rhodesian exports were generally competitive and had previously been entitled to preferential treatment on the British market, the former colony did not recognise the need for escalating the pace of diversification before independence. Following the UDI, however, Rhodesia began to demonstrate that it had the potential to develop a greater degree of economic self-sufficiency. After the Rhodesian Front began introducing incentives accorded to domestic production, industrial output expanded dramatically. A rigid system of countermeasures enacted to combat sanctions succeeded in blunting their impact for at least a decade. Over the next nine years Rhodesian companies, spiting the freezing of their assets and blocking of overseas accounts, also perfected cunning techniques of sanctions evasion through both local and foreign subsidiaries, which operated on a clandestine trade network.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From 1968 until 1970, there was virtually no further dialogue between Rhodesia and the UK. In a referendum in 1969, white voters approved a new constitution and the establishment of a republic, thereby severing Rhodesia&#039;s last links with the British Crown, duly declared in March 1970. This changed immediately after the election of Edward Heath, who reopened negotiations. In November 1971, Douglas-Home renewed contacts with Salisbury and announced a proposed agreement that would be satisfactory to both sides &amp;#8211; it recognised Rhodesia&#039;s 1969 constitution as the legal frame of government, while agreeing that gradual legislative representation was an acceptable formula for unhindered advance to majority rule. Nevertheless, the new settlement, if approved, would also implement an immediate improvement in black political status, offer a means to terminate racial discrimination, and provide a solid guarantee against retrogressive constitutional amendments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As early as 1960, minority rule in Southern Rhodesia was already being challenged by a rising tide of political violence led by African nationalists such as Joshua Nkomo and Ndabaningi Sithole. After their public campaigns were initially suppressed, many believed that negotiation was completely incapable of meeting their aspirations. Petrol bombings by radicals became increasingly common. It was officially noted that between January and September 1962 alone, 33 bombings were carried out, in addition to 27 acts of attempted sabotage on communications. In that same period, nationalists were implicated in arson targeting 18 schools and 10 churches. Nkomo&#039;s Zimbabwe African People&#039;s Union (ZAPU) subsequently disclosed that it had formed a military wing, the Zimbabwe People&#039;s Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA), and &#039;the decision to start bringing in arms and ammunition and to send young men away for sabotage training&#039; had already been made. The Rhodesian authorities responded by banning ZAPU and driving its supporters underground. Frustrated by their repeated failures, nationalists also conducted a campaign of terror against black Africans, murdering those who had either identified with the colonial administration or had simply failed to demonstrate their allegiance to the cause. To protect civilians, emergency laws were imposed, broadening the legal definition of unlawful gatherings and giving the police greater powers to crack down on agitators or subversives. The death sentence was also introduced for terrorism involving explosives and arson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A crisis of confidence soon resulted across ZAPU, which was already suffering from poor morale, compounded by tribal and ideological factionalism. In 1963, party dissidents rejected Joshua Nkomo&#039;s authority and formed their own organisation, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) &amp;#8211; which worked out its own strategy for impressing international opinion, undermining white assurance, and achieving a complete breakdown of order. By August 1964, ZANU was banned by the Rhodesian government as well, which cited widespread intimidation by that party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ZANU&#039;s agenda was inward-looking, leftist, and pan-Africanist in nature. After being forced from Rhodesia, they continued to operate in exile, creating occupation groups representing urban workers, miners, and peasant farmers. ZANU also attracted professionals, students, and feminists to its ranks. While ZAPU theoretically continued to command the allegiance of most Ndebele and Shona activists, Sithole and Mugabe drew their support base from the rural peasantry in the Mashonaland countryside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the UDI, ZANU officials mapped an elaborate plan for the &quot;liberation of Zimbabwe&quot; which called for attacks on white farmers, destruction of cash crops, disrupting electricity in urban areas, and petrol bombings. They also formed an armed wing of their own, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sithole and Nkomo both insisted on the need for armed struggle, but disagreed on the means to go about it. For example, ZIPRA tended to follow Soviet thinking, placing an emphasis on sophisticated weaponry in the hopes of winning a conventional battle like the Viet Minh at Dien Bien Phu. ZANLA militants preferred to politicise populations in areas which they intended to seize. Neither force, however, had acquired basic knowledge of guerrilla warfare. Debate on political theory and insurgent tactics became the obsession of nationalists at this stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In April 1966, two ZANLA units, having received prior training at Nanjing Military College, crossed into Rhodesia from Zambia. They were armed with SKS carbines, hand grenades, explosives, and communist pamphlets, having been issued vague instructions to sabotage important installations before killing white persons indiscriminately. At least five guerrillas were simply arrested before getting very far. Another seven hoped to destroy a pylon carrying electricity to Sinoia in the northwest. Their faulty demolitions were uncovered by the Rhodesian Security Forces and the men easily tracked to a nearby ranch on 28 April, where they were shot resisting capture. This event is considered to have been the first engagement of what came to be known as the &quot;Bush War&quot; in Rhodesia and the &quot;Second Chimurenga&quot; (or rebellion in Shona) by supporters of the guerrillas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The campaign proper is generally considered to have started in 1972 with the Attack on Altena Farm, despite the minor threat already represented by the nationalist movements in the 1960s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After unsuccessful appeals to Britain and the United States for military assistance, Robert Mugabe, who was based in Mozambique after that country&#039;s independence from Portugal in 1975, led ZANU to seek support from the People&#039;s Republic of China and countries of the Soviet Bloc. Joshua Nkomo, based in Zambia and also supported by the Soviet Union, led ZAPU. ZANU and ZAPU together formed &#039;the Patriotic Front&#039;. Broadly, ZANLA recruited mainly from Mashonaland and Manicaland provinces, whilst the ZIPRA recruited from Mashonaland West, Midlands and Matabeleland provinces of Zimbabwe. As Mugabe had described himself in an interview as a &quot;Marxist-Leninist of Maoist Thought&quot;, which enraged the Kremlin, Soviet support went exclusively to ZAPU while China supported ZANU. Soviet arms went to the ZAPU via Zambia and Mozambique, and Nkomo was in regular contact with Vasili Grigoryevich Solodovnikov, the Soviet ambassador to Zambia who was also known to be associated with the KGB. Nkomo, who depended heavily on Soviet arms, had what he called an &quot;extensive correspondence&quot; with Yuri Andropov, the KGB chief, while officers from the Cuban DGI provided training for the ZAPU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the collapse of Portuguese rule in Mozambique in 1974&amp;#8211;75, it was no longer viable for the Smith regime to sustain white minority rule indefinitely. By this time, even South Africa&#039;s Vorster had come to this view. While Vorster was unwilling to make concessions to his own country&#039;s blacks, he concluded that white minority rule was not sustainable in a country where blacks outnumbered whites 22:1. In 1978, there were 270,000 Rhodesians of European descent and more than six million Africans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;International business groups involved in the country (e.g. Lonrho) transferred their support from the Rhodesian government to black nationalist parties. Business leaders and politicians feted Nkomo on his visits to Europe. ZANU also attracted business supporters who saw the course that future events were likely to take. Funding and arms support provided by supporters, particularly from the Soviet Union and its allies in the latter 1970s, allowed both ZIPRA and the ZANLA to acquire more sophisticated weaponry, thereby increasing the military pressure that the guerrillas were able to place on Rhodesia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until 1972, containing the guerrillas was little more than a police action. Even as late as August 1975 when Rhodesian government and black nationalist leaders met at Victoria Falls for negotiations brokered by South Africa and Zambia, the talks never got beyond the procedural phase. Rhodesian representatives made it clear they were prepared to fight an all out war to prevent majority rule. However, the situation changed dramatically after the end of Portuguese colonial rule in Mozambique in 1975. Rhodesia now found itself almost entirely surrounded by hostile states and even South Africa, its only real ally, pressed for a settlement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, ZANU&#039;s alliance with FRELIMO (the Liberation Front of Mozambique) and the porous border between Mozambique and eastern Rhodesia enabled large-scale training and infiltration of ZANU/ZANLA fighters. The governments of Zambia and Botswana were also emboldened sufficiently to allow resistance movement bases to be set up in their territories. Guerrillas began to launch operations deep inside Rhodesia, attacking roads, railways, economic targets and isolated security force positions, in 1976.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The government adopted a &#039;strategic hamlets&#039; policy of the kind used in Malaya and Vietnam to restrict the influence of insurgents over the population of rural areas. Local people were forced to relocate to protected villages (PVs) which were strictly controlled and guarded by the government against rebel atrocities. The protected villages were compared by the guerrillas to concentration camps. Some contemporary accounts claim that this interference in the lives of local residents induced many of them who had previously been neutral to support the guerrillas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A major problem for the Rhodesian state in fighting the Bush War was always a shortage of manpower. Of the 3,000 white men liable for conscription in 1973, only about 1,000 reported when called-up. In February 1978, the Rhodesian Army stated it needed a minimum of 1,041 men to continue combat operations, and of those called up, only 570 reported for duty while the rest chose to move to South Africa. The Rhodesian Army consistently out-fought the ZANU and ZAPU guerillas. However, white emigration caused a shortage of military manpower. White emigration increased as the state called up more and more men to fight in the war, creating a vicious circle, which gradually limited the capacity of the Rhodesian state to continue the war. In order to stop white emigration, the Smith government brought in a law in 1975 forbidding Rhodesian citizens from holding foreign currency, but the law was widely flouted. In order to encourage white emigration, the guerrillas of ZANU and ZAPU followed a strategy of attacking anything and everything that was of economic value across the country in order to force the state to call up more men, and of killing white civilians. Killing Rhodesian white citizens tended to have an &quot;echo effect&quot; as the ZANU and ZAPU had both estimated that for 1 white citizen killed, it caused about 20 to leave Rhodesia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhodesia began to lose vital economic and military support from South Africa, which, while sympathetic to the white minority government, never accorded it diplomatic recognition. The South African government placed limits on the fuel and munitions they supplied to the Rhodesian military. They also withdrew the personnel and equipment that they had previously provided to aid the war effort, though covert military support continued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1976, the South African government and United States governments worked together to place pressure on Smith to agree to a form of majority rule. In response to the initiative of US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, in 1976 Ian Smith accepted the principle of black majority rule within two years. The Rhodesians now offered more concessions, but those concessions, focused on reaching an &quot;internal settlement&quot; with moderate black leaders, were insufficient to end the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time, some Rhodesians said the still embittered history between the British-dominated Rhodesia and the Afrikaner-dominated South Africa partly led the South African government to withdraw its aid to Rhodesia. Ian Smith said in his memoirs that even though many white South Africans supported Rhodesia, South African Prime Minister John Vorster&#039;s policy of d&amp;#233;tente with the Black African states ended up with Rhodesia being offered as the &quot;sacrificial lamb&quot; to buy more time for South Africa. Other observers perceived South Africa&#039;s distancing itself from Rhodesia as being an early move in the process that led to majority rule in South Africa itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the latter 1970s, the militants had successfully put the economy of Rhodesia under significant pressure while the numbers of guerrillas in the country were steadily increasing. The government abandoned its early strategy of trying to defend the borders in favour of trying to defend key economic areas and lines of communication with South Africa, while the rest of the countryside became a patchwork of &quot;no-go areas&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the late 1970s, Rhodesia&#039;s front-line forces contained about 25,000 regular troops and police &amp;#8211; backed up by relatively strong army and police reserves. Its mechanised contingent consisted of light armoured cars and improvised mine-protected armoured personnel carriers, complemented by eight tanks (Polish built T-55LD tanks), delivered in the last year of the war. The Rhodesian Air Force operated an assortment of both Canberra light bombers, Hawker Hunter fighter bombers, older de Havilland Vampire jets as well as a somewhat antiquated, but still potent, helicopter arm. These forces, including highly trained special operations units, were capable of launching devastating raids on resistance movement camps outside the country, as in Operation Dingo in 1977 and other similar operations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, guerrilla pressure inside the country itself was steadily increasing in the latter 1970s. By 1978&amp;#8211;79, the war had become a contest between the guerrilla warfare placing ever increasing pressure on the Rhodesian regime and civil population, and the Rhodesian government&#039;s strategy of trying to hold off the militants until external recognition for a compromise political settlement with moderate black leaders could be secured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By this time, the need to cut a deal was apparent to most Rhodesians, but not to all. Ian Smith had dismissed his intransigent Defence Minister, P. K. van der Byl, as early as 1976. Van der Byl was a hard-line opponent of any form of compromise with domestic opposition or the international community since before UDI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shooting down on 3 September 1978 of the civilian Vickers Viscount airliner Hunyani, Air Rhodesia Flight RH825, in the Kariba area by ZIPRA fighters using a surface-to-air missile, with the subsequent massacre of its survivors, is widely considered to be the event that finally destroyed the Rhodesians&#039; will to continue the war. Although militarily insignificant, the loss of this aircraft (and a second Viscount, the Umniati, in 1979) demonstrated the reach of resistance movements extended to Rhodesian civil society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rhodesians&#039; means to continue the war were also eroding fast. In December 1978, a ZANLA unit penetrated the outskirts of Salisbury and fired a volley of rockets and incendiary device rounds into the main oil storage depot &amp;#8211; the most heavily defended economic asset in the country. The storage tanks burned for five days, giving off a column of smoke that could be seen 130 kilometres away. Five hundred thousand barrels (79,000 m3) of petroleum product (comprising Rhodesia&#039;s strategic oil reserve) were lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rhodesian army continued its &quot;mobile counter-offensive&quot; strategy of holding key positions (&quot;vital asset ground&quot;) while carrying out raids into the no-go areas and into neighbouring countries. While often extraordinarily successful in inflicting heavy guerrilla casualties, such raids also on occasion failed to achieve their objectives. In April 1979 special forces carried out a raid on Joshua Nkomo&#039;s residence in Lusaka (Zambia) with the stated intention of assassinating him. Nkomo and his family left hastily a few hours before the raid &amp;#8211; having clearly been warned that the raid was coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1979, some special forces units were accused of using counterinsurgent operations as cover for ivory poaching and smuggling. Colonel Reid-Daly (commander of the Selous Scouts) discovered that his phone was bugged and after challenging a superior officer on this issue was court martialled for insubordination. He received the lightest sentence possible, a caution, but he continued to fight his conviction and eventually resigned his commission and left the Army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the result of an Internal Settlement signed on 3 March 1978 between the Rhodesian government and the moderate African nationalist parties, which were not in exile and not involved in the war, elections were held in April 1979. The United African National Council (UANC) party won a majority in this election, and its leader, Abel Muzorewa (a United Methodist Church bishop), became the country&#039;s first black prime minister on 1 June 1979. The country&#039;s name was changed to Zimbabwe Rhodesia. The internal settlement left control of the country&#039;s police, security forces, civil service and judiciary in white hands, for the moment. It assured whites of about one third of the seats in parliament. It was essentially a power-sharing arrangement between whites and blacks which, in the eyes of many, particularly the insurgents, did not amount to majority rule. However, the United States Senate voted to end economic sanctions against Zimbabwe Rhodesia on 12 June.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the 1979 election was described by the Rhodesian government as non-racial and democratic, it did not include the main nationalist parties ZANU and ZAPU. In spite of offers from Ian Smith, the latter parties declined to participate in an election in which their political position would be insecure and under a proposed constitution which they had played no part in drafting and which was perceived as retaining strong white minority privilege.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bishop Muzorewa&#039;s government did not receive international recognition. The Bush War continued unabated and sanctions were not lifted. The international community refused to accept the validity of any agreement which did not incorporate the main nationalist parties. The British Government (then led by the recently elected Margaret Thatcher) issued invitations to all parties to attend a peace conference at Lancaster House. These negotiations took place in London in late 1979. The three-month-long conference almost failed to reach conclusion, due to disagreements on land reform, but resulted in the Lancaster House Agreement. UDI ended, and Rhodesia temporarily reverted to the status of a British colony (the &#039;Colony of Southern Rhodesia&#039;). As per the agreement, Lord Soames became Governor with full legislative and executive powers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lancaster House Agreement further provided for a ceasefire which was followed by an internationally supervised general election, held on February 1980. ZANU led by Robert Mugabe won this election, some alleged, by terrorising its political opposition, including supporters of ZAPU, through former insurgents that had not confined themselves to the designated guerrilla assembly points, as stipulated by the Lancaster House Agreement. The observers and Soames were accused of looking the other way, and Mugabe&#039;s victory was certified. Nevertheless, few could doubt that Mugabe&#039;s support within his majority Shona tribal group was extremely strong. The Rhodesian military seriously considered mounting a coup against a perceived stolen election (&quot;Operation Quartz&quot;) to prevent ZANU from taking over the country. The alleged coup was to include the assassination of Mugabe and coordinated assaults on guerrilla assembly points throughout the country. The plan was eventually scuttled, as it was obvious that Mugabe enjoyed widespread support from the black majority despite voter intimidation, as well as the fact that the coup would gain no external support, and a conflagration which would engulf the country was seen as inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mugabe and the victorious black nationalists were rather less concerned by Operation Quartz than by the possibility that there might be a mass exodus of the white community of the kind that had caused chaos in Mozambique five years earlier. Such an exodus had been prepared for by the South African government. With the agreement of the British Governor of Rhodesia, South African troops had entered the country to secure the road approaches to the Beit Bridge border crossing point. Refugee camps had been prepared in the Transvaal. On the day the election results became known, most white families had prepared contingency plans for flight, including the packing of cars and suitcases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after a meeting with Robert Mugabe and the central committee of ZANU (PF), Ian Smith was reassured that whites could and should stay in the new Zimbabwe. Mugabe promised that he would abide strictly by the terms of the Lancaster House Agreement and that changes in Zimbabwe would be made gradually and by a proper legal process. Mugabe, however, would reverse his commitment to these agreements some years later; the regime began confiscating white-owned farmlands. This is widely blamed for leading to the deterioration of the Zimbabwean economy, which plagues the country today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On 18 April 1980 the country became independent within the Commonwealth of Nations as the Republic of Zimbabwe, and its capital, Salisbury, was renamed Harare two years later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://t00.deviantart.net/Pd8NzgX1tsaPy3qRnqMbCuFcokA=/300x200/filters:fixed_height(100,100):origin()/pre00/3b85/th/pre/f/2018/290/0/4/republic_of_rhodesia_by_gregi989-dcpnlab.png&quot; alt=&quot;thumbnail&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>            </item>

        <media:copyright url="https://quantumbranching.deviantart.com">Copyright 2012-2019 QuantumBranching</media:copyright>            <media:description type="html">OK, the exciting conclusion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody knows how exactly the warhead made its way from China to the hands of the Iraqi resistance. Rumors that it had been transported by a US nuclear submarine that had somehow remained on the loose for over fifteen years were later dismissed by the Soviets as paranoid fantasy. [1] However, it is known that it made its way to Moscow as part of a consignment of supposedly illegal drugs destined for high (and frequently “high”) Politburo members, with plentiful bribes and authentic-looking documentation on hand and cushioned in bags of the finest Afghan opium. Negotiations for the transfer of said narcotics were actually under way in downtown Moscow that afternoon of September, 2003, when the warhead went off, taking out a sizeable chunk of the city including the Kremlin and most of the Soviet leadership, the Politburo being in full session at the time. Central authority temporarily collapsed, and rebellion broke out all over Eastern Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The world did not burn in nuclear fire, since - unlike a couple decades earlier - there was no immediately obvious suspect, and soviet nuclear arsenals were not on hair-trigger alert. Still, the first few hours were pretty white-knuckle-ish)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turmoil also broke out in the USSR proper, as several different people claimed that they represented the proper line of succession, and nationalist revolt broke out in the Baltic States, Iraq, Kurdistan and the Trans-Caucuses. (The careful and corrupt leadership of the Central Asian states carefully stayed immobile, as did the Mongolians – unpleasant neighbors, you know). There was still no recognized government some weeks later when radiological scientists reported that judging from the fallout product, the weapon was most likely of Chinese origin: this did not prevent Mendeleev’s Leningrad regime from making use of the missile bases under its control to blow up several of China’s remaining cities, in spite of loud protestations by the government that it must have come from the Maoist Fundamentalist faction (still holding on in Qinghai and Sichuan). Pro-Soviet puppet regimes in America and Eastern Europe collapsed like a house of cards in most cases, although the hard man the Soviets had given the nod to replace Ceausescu managed to stay in power for a while through savage measures. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Leningrad regime did not long survive, nor did the Kiev faction: by early 2004 an army-KGB alliance had taken control of the big cities and set about a flurry of purges. The absence of the head of the KGB at the time of the disaster has led to a great deal of paranoid theorizing, but Chairman Putin has always been a survivor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highly centralized economy pretty much collapsed with the destruction of the Moscow “head”, and only food aid from the European Community prevented large-scale famine as distribution systems fell into disarray (ugly rumors remain about deliberate starvation policies directed at rebelling Georgians and Azeris). Restoring the economy to some sort of functioning level took nearly two years, and large parts of the Soviet Empire were forced to work on an improvised barter system for lengthy periods. In the end, the pragmatic new leadership decided that a policy of “nuke the US and Eastern Europe until they let us occupy them again” would be more trouble than it was worth, especially since it gave them no incentive to avoid doing something like 9/7/03 again…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;************************************************** *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STILL NUMBER ONE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2012, the Soviet Union is still the dominant global power, but by necessity has been forced to diminish the scope of its planetary empire. It still has a wide constellation of allies, but a lot of them are principally Soviet aid black holes, and after fourteen years of economic reforms (with a two year time out for emergency measures) the Soviet economy is looking capitalist enough that it feels a bit silly to be supporting such determinedly old-fashioned Stalinists as the Koreans and the Indonesians. The increased dissonance between ideology and practice threatens to undermine social stability, and the government has been working hard to promote a “Soviet nationalism” to combat the attractions of local ethnicity. The government is presently located in Leningrad: supposedly it will return to Moscow when the rebuilding is done and the fallout dies back a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The economy is finally growing at a clip better than anything seen since the early 70s, in spite of the fact that the Europeans are no longer importing any gas or oil to speak of: Soviet industrial combines increasingly work like international corporations, seeking market share abroad (and quite often essentially control the economies of many Soviet allies, which is an increasing cause of resentment in Africa and Latin America). Government censorship has been relaxed, allowing for a bit of a cultural and entertainment efflorescence, but anything that looks like separatism or rebellion is brutally repressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Soviet global dominance is less open than it used to be, and weak nations no longer feel the need to loudly trumpet their socialist credentials, there are very definite limits: with the exception of the EC and India (which have few anyway) nobody is allowed to have nuclear weapons. The government has made it quite clear that any nuke-building will immediately be followed by a visit from Comrade Missile, and perhaps as an example, the Soviets are in the habit of ever now and then lobbing (non-nuclear, but quite ouchie) missiles at any suspicious Chinese structures the spy satellites spot. Space programs other than the EC’s are forbidden (satellite launch capacity = ICBM capacity) except in “partnership” with the USSR, which essentially means you pony up the money and a satellite and they launch it for you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;China remains a Problem. After the government got back on its feet, there was an effort to overthrow the Chinese government in retaliation for the bombing (which the Chinese still insisted they had nothing to do with) but after a limited penetration into what turned out to be a pretty nasty wasp’s nest the Soviets established a new depopulated border zone and stood pat: there was talk of nuking China into oblivion, but besides looking bad in front of the Joneses by this point Chinese population and industry was so dispersed (and often underground) that bombing them back to the stone age would require so many bombs as to radioactively poison half the USSR and possibly bring on a nuclear winter (Soviet scientists had studies Sagan’s work with interest). So essentially China was let be, and used for occasional target practice. Contact with the outside world is limited, but from what is known the Chinese state is an insanely regulated totalitarianism designed for survival at all costs, and with an army comprising perhaps ten percent of the entire population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Japan, where a more “pragmatic” political coalition replaced (with much Soviet prodding) the “enthusiasts” of the early post-US years, has mutated into an odd blend of state as corporation and Socialist dictatorship, with lots of patriotic singing and marching and everything planned by computer to maximize productivity (and robots). What somewhat worries the Soviets is that the Japanese system seems genuinely competitive – the economy is now growing rather faster than the USSR. Of course, it’s possible they are just faking the numbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Middle East is pretty much a wash for the Soviets, although they have retained much of their oil muscle with harsh measures. Afghanistan is actually fairly quiet nowadays, and has slowly made it out of the Middle Ages into the bright lights of, say, 1930s Turkey. Speaking of which, although the Soviet Union has not used force to restore a pro-USSR government in Turkey, the Straits are still under Soviet control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EUROPES&lt;br /&gt;The European Community is now 100% powered by local coal, solar and nuclear power (in spite of that unfortunate little incident in Italy). Cars are all electric. It’s poorer than our Europe, but quite egalitarian, and somewhat smug about how civilized they are compared to the thuggish Soviets or the revanchist, perpetually pissed Americans. This to some extent covers a deep, nagging feeling of insecurity and a sense of shame at having survived by carefully kissing up to their neighbor to the east for years. Now there is little chance of the Red Army storming west, but a certain cringe remains. Many Europeans bombastically call for a New Europe, a Europe that Can Say No, a Europe capable of standing up to Leningrad. Other Europeans ponder the limited number of European nukes capable of hitting the USSR and the still huge Soviet arsenal and shudder and shake their heads in disbelief at the idiot. Economic ties with North America and Eastern Europe continue to grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UK, always more geographically protected from Soviet non-nuclear forces, has taken a sharp turn to the right, and Margaret Thatcher has been “rehabilitated” to the point of getting a statue in Parliament. [2] Germany was officially united at last in 2006, after the EC (Germany most of all) paid some truly massive bribes (“recovery aid”) to the USSR (it had “informally” been united shortly after the nuking of Moscow, when the East German government collapsed like a bad soufflé). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the Soviets have nixed any expansion of the EC further east, so although the former Warsaw pact nations are now trading vigorously with the west (and sending loads of immigrants thataway) they remain politically nonaligned. Under Polish leadership they have formed an alliance of their own, the Prague Pact, including governments varying from the quite democratic Czecho-Slovak Union to the Greek Junta. Of the former enlarged Warsaw Pact nations Yugoslavia is an exception: the USSR having supported its challenge to Croatia re Bosnian borders when Poland, etc. would not, the Serbs have rediscovered their love for their fellow Orthodox Slavs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REUNITED AND IT FEELS SO GOOD&lt;br /&gt;The non-Soviet East European troops mostly joined the rebels or deserted when the news from home came in, and those from east of Poland mostly withdrew to their bases. The situation had not improved from 1997: although many Americans were willing to go along with the notion of trading national unity for normal economic and political conditions, such views were poorly represented among the actual rebels, which flocked to the new “Heartland Republic” in hopes of spoiling the new initiative. In spite of optimistic reports by local officials (“if we fight them in the Heartland, we won’t have to fight them in California”), the movement of large numbers of troops from elsewhere led to the embarrassing takeover of Boise and the declaration of the “free republic of Idaho.” The 2001 nuking of the city temporarily dampened the rebellion, but pretty much blew any remaining legitimacy for collaborating governments, none of which lasted through the winter of ‘03.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2012, the United States is once again a nation. The Deep South and Texas rejoined “with conditions”, retaining certain local autonomies and the right of legal secession if the damn Yankees ever get pestiferous again: Hawaii has its own special arrangements. Total population is rather lower than OTL, immigration to the US being understandably lower during the occupation years, and children more expensive: the current total is about 267 million. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relations with Cuba are even worse than OTL: Puerto Rico is Unredeemed Territory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living standards have grown rapidly with rapid post-unification growth as the US once again became an integrated economy. (In fact, Soviet statisticians have noted that US living standards once again exceed Soviet ones, something that is not reported to the general Soviet public). With the traditional political parties somewhat tainted by collaboration in the early years of the Occupation, there are now New Democrats, Truman Republicans, and five other political parties to confuse voters at the polls. Said politics remain turbulent, as people point fingers and try to prove their credentials as the most anti-Commie, resistance-fightingest, super-patriot ever. (Ironically, the economy is by OTL standards rather socialist: the reconstruction of the country and its infrastructure and the need to keep people employed means that the government does a lot of social spending, and employs rather more of the population than OTL).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York City, having been governed separately from the rest of the NE Occupation Zone, decided afterwards it didn’t want to rejoin a state whose government took more in taxes from them than they ever received in government benefits (and then told them to drop dead when they had a financial crisis) and formed its own state out of the Five Boroughs and a large chunk of Long Island. The now largely rural rest of the state is currently feuding with them over the name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The US is forbidden by the USSR from developing nuclear weapons or space capacity, and the Soviets have made it clear that any efforts to, say, embargo the USSR would be seen as a hostile act; indeed, the Soviets are currently trying to pressure the US into paying off a huge debt the Soviets claim they owe for reparations due to losses when the occupation collapsed! Americans grumble, and curse, and some of them, in hidden places and in European labs, carry on with certain projects…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER NATIONS&lt;br /&gt;To the south of China, most of SE Asia sticks close to the USSR for fear of the Chinese. The Singapore Pact nations are a small island of moderately successful capitalism in a Socialist sea, and trade vigorously with Europe and the few other functional Capitalisms. They have been trying to get Thailand to join up, but the Vietnamese have been rather cold to the idea. Burma/Myanmar is depressingly similar to OTL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Arabia, Rabi’ Bin Laden, inspired by his cousin Osama’s heroic death in Afghanistan, became one of the leaders of the rebellion, initially based in breakaway N. Yemen, that overthrew the House of Saud, seen as compromised by kowtowing to the Soviets. The Islamic Union after the Soviets sliced away the Shi’a regions still has enough oil to pull it out of dirt-poor status, although the large proportion of dirt-poor Yemenis who have come north in search of jobs since unification are a source of internal stresses. So far, this world considers political Islam as more of a nuisance than a severe threat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Israelis have indignantly denied rumors of having developed a vast chemical and biological arsenal, and it’s true there is no serious evidence: but nobody knows just how deep down those tunnels under Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities go…&lt;br /&gt;(There are less than 3% Arabs within the borders of the shrunken Israeli state. The rest have been energetically encouraged to move to “their” country, unpleasant as many of them have found the one-party regime that rules it. Given their parlous situation, the only Jews who live in Israel are the, shall we say, highly dedicated ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;South Africa continues to bleed. Africa is generally as screwed up as OTL, although some of the Soviet-backed Red regimes at least offer a bit more stability and more actual nation-building than the historical kleptocracies: unfortunately, Africa seems likely to actually fall behind ours as the globalization-aided boom that many African countries OTL have experienced in recent years is not being duplicated in this poorer, more socialistic world. The AIDS epidemic is also as ghastly as OTL, not helped by the fact that the poorer first world of this TL took nearly a decade longer to develop effective medications. At least in this TL there aren’t any international corporations trying to sue the makers of generics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The AIDS plague outside Africa is actually a bit more controlled: China due to relative isolation has avoided it entirely, and the Soviet medical establishment has done a better job of keeping it under control than the post-Soviet states of OTL).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Latin America is divided into a still “red” and pro-Soviet block and a more capitalistic (if still often a bit socialistic) block of nations edging towards closer ties with the market economies of the US, Canada, and Europe. The Soviet-aligned nations face difficult choices in terms of economic reform and often political turmoil: the dream of a unified socialist Latin America does not really reach beyond the political control of Havana, and people wonder if Castro’s brother and other political leaders can really keep the show on the road once Castro (currently on some good drugs) finally goes the way of all flesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;************************************************** *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technology is generally more backwards in this world than OTL: the US, Japan and other places have of course contributed less to progress since 1987, and a Soviet science establishment superior to that OTL post-1991 Russia does not make up for that. The Soviets have kept Mir in orbit and enlarged and modernized it, but with nothing to prove to anyone haven’t bothered to do any manned travel beyond Earth Orbit. They have developed a space shuttle, in fact a better designed one and a more reliable one than the OTL US one, but haven’t really done too much with it: Heavy Dumb Boosters remain the basis for putting stuff into orbit, and the satellite business is dominated by Soviet launchers, with a smaller EC effort ongoing. Computer science is also more backwards, as are consumer electronics: only in the last few years have European parents started to grumble about how much time their children are spending on the “network.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The future still looks pretty Grimdark, and most people doubt the Soviets will ever allow a serious challenger to arise to their Top Dog position, but at least, most people say, we’re not going to have a nuclear war, right? The Soviets will never tolerate a new arms race…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[1] Even more absurd were the rumors as to the identity of the “mystery sub”: after all, rather than return the stolen ship, the Americans had blown it up and sunk it. They had even shown the wreckage to Soviet divers, who reported that it was indeed the Red October.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[2] Yes, I know this was OTL…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EPILOGUE: 2016&lt;br /&gt;June 17, an unusually large “science package” was launched into orbit from French Guyana. A high orbit, and a geostationary orbit. One that put it in line-of-sight of all but the northernmost parts of the USSR. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was unprecedented: various agreements between the EC and the USSR meant that each informed the other, in advance, about exactly what they were going to do with those ICBM-type things used to launch objects into space. The Soviets grumbled loudly, and turning telescopes on the science package and finding it unidentifiable, made noises about shooting it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tiny folded piece of paper covered with tiny scribbles made its way by various hands through the Soviet Union, from there to East Germany, and eventually to Western Europe. It arrived in America in February, 1987: too late, for those into whose hands it was finally delivered neither understood it nor believed its brief appeal. By the time it came to those who could confirm its reality, time had run out. Despairing, the original author of the note committed suicide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The US ambassador to the USSR at this point delivered certain papers to the Soviet government. Papers, he explained, relevant to the current situation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scribbles were soon copied more legibly. A small group of scientists in San Francisco studied them. Later a British businessman carried a copy of the paper and their additions back to Europe, where further work would be done. After 2005, the main area of activity would return to America, where the scattered biological components of what had been Sandia Labs returned to the looted shell of what had been one of the world’s primary research institutions. Stark Industries, a highly successful new high-tech startup, would prove a vital technological partner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By 2015, the only thing needed was a means to put a large payload into orbit. Certain behind the scenes negotiations began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soviet scientists examined the papers with care and increasing alarm. An emergency session of the Politburo was called.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;European and American scientists had substantially improved upon Ivan Vanko’s 1987 design: any Soviet missile launch would lead to the USSR being knocked back to the 19th century. For better or for worse, MAD was back.</media:description>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/P0Tq9pSAh55O6ro83I8E1K0THDY=/fit-in/150x150/filters:no_upscale():origin()/pre00/f36b/th/pre/i/2012/079/0/0/amerika_2012_by_quantumbranching-d4tc6ok.png" height="97" width="150"/>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/ld9uycFQ1E8ePEZ1XH3FYneyZ9k=/fit-in/300x900/filters:no_upscale():origin()/pre00/f36b/th/pre/i/2012/079/0/0/amerika_2012_by_quantumbranching-d4tc6ok.png" height="193" width="300"/>            <media:thumbnail url="https://t00.deviantart.net/7bVxov1uom6hoAR5vpagE8ksTog=/300x200/filters:fixed_height(100,100):origin()/pre00/f36b/th/pre/i/2012/079/0/0/amerika_2012_by_quantumbranching-d4tc6ok.png" height="193" width="300"/>            <media:content url="https://img00.deviantart.net/c1ae/i/2012/079/0/0/amerika_2012_by_quantumbranching-d4tc6ok.png" height="579" width="900" medium="image"/>            
            <description>OK, the exciting conclusion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody knows how exactly the warhead made its way from China to the hands of the Iraqi resistance. Rumors that it had been transported by a US nuclear submarine that had somehow remained on the loose for over fifteen years were later dismissed by the Soviets as paranoid fantasy. [1] However, it is known that it made its way to Moscow as part of a consignment of supposedly illegal drugs destined for high (and frequently “high”) Politburo members, with plentiful bribes and authentic-looking documentation on hand and cushioned in bags of the finest Afghan opium. Negotiations for the transfer of said narcotics were actually under way in downtown Moscow that afternoon of September, 2003, when the warhead went off, taking out a sizeable chunk of the city including the Kremlin and most of the Soviet leadership, the Politburo being in full session at the time. Central authority temporarily collapsed, and rebellion broke out all over Eastern Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The world did not burn in nuclear fire, since - unlike a couple decades earlier - there was no immediately obvious suspect, and soviet nuclear arsenals were not on hair-trigger alert. Still, the first few hours were pretty white-knuckle-ish)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turmoil also broke out in the USSR proper, as several different people claimed that they represented the proper line of succession, and nationalist revolt broke out in the Baltic States, Iraq, Kurdistan and the Trans-Caucuses. (The careful and corrupt leadership of the Central Asian states carefully stayed immobile, as did the Mongolians – unpleasant neighbors, you know). There was still no recognized government some weeks later when radiological scientists reported that judging from the fallout product, the weapon was most likely of Chinese origin: this did not prevent Mendeleev’s Leningrad regime from making use of the missile bases under its control to blow up several of China’s remaining cities, in spite of loud protestations by the government that it must have come from the Maoist Fundamentalist faction (still holding on in Qinghai and Sichuan). Pro-Soviet puppet regimes in America and Eastern Europe collapsed like a house of cards in most cases, although the hard man the Soviets had given the nod to replace Ceausescu managed to stay in power for a while through savage measures. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Leningrad regime did not long survive, nor did the Kiev faction: by early 2004 an army-KGB alliance had taken control of the big cities and set about a flurry of purges. The absence of the head of the KGB at the time of the disaster has led to a great deal of paranoid theorizing, but Chairman Putin has always been a survivor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highly centralized economy pretty much collapsed with the destruction of the Moscow “head”, and only food aid from the European Community prevented large-scale famine as distribution systems fell into disarray (ugly rumors remain about deliberate starvation policies directed at rebelling Georgians and Azeris). Restoring the economy to some sort of functioning level took nearly two years, and large parts of the Soviet Empire were forced to work on an improvised barter system for lengthy periods. In the end, the pragmatic new leadership decided that a policy of “nuke the US and Eastern Europe until they let us occupy them again” would be more trouble than it was worth, especially since it gave them no incentive to avoid doing something like 9/7/03 again…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;************************************************** *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STILL NUMBER ONE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2012, the Soviet Union is still the dominant global power, but by necessity has been forced to diminish the scope of its planetary empire. It still has a wide constellation of allies, but a lot of them are principally Soviet aid black holes, and after fourteen years of economic reforms (with a two year time out for emergency measures) the Soviet economy is looking capitalist enough that it feels a bit silly to be supporting such determinedly old-fashioned Stalinists as the Koreans and the Indonesians. The increased dissonance between ideology and practice threatens to undermine social stability, and the government has been working hard to promote a “Soviet nationalism” to combat the attractions of local ethnicity. The government is presently located in Leningrad: supposedly it will return to Moscow when the rebuilding is done and the fallout dies back a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The economy is finally growing at a clip better than anything seen since the early 70s, in spite of the fact that the Europeans are no longer importing any gas or oil to speak of: Soviet industrial combines increasingly work like international corporations, seeking market share abroad (and quite often essentially control the economies of many Soviet allies, which is an increasing cause of resentment in Africa and Latin America). Government censorship has been relaxed, allowing for a bit of a cultural and entertainment efflorescence, but anything that looks like separatism or rebellion is brutally repressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Soviet global dominance is less open than it used to be, and weak nations no longer feel the need to loudly trumpet their socialist credentials, there are very definite limits: with the exception of the EC and India (which have few anyway) nobody is allowed to have nuclear weapons.

The Soviets have kept Mir in orbit and enlarged and modernized it, but with nothing to prove to anyone haven’t bothered to do any manned travel beyond Earth Orbit. They have developed a space shuttle, in fact a better designed one and a more reliable one than the OTL US one, but haven’t really done too much with it: Heavy Dumb Boosters remain the basis for putting stuff into orbit, and the satellite business is dominated by Soviet launchers, with a smaller EC effort ongoing. Computer science is also more backwards, as are consumer electronics: only in the last few years have European parents started to grumble about how much time their children are spending on the “network.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The future still looks pretty Grimdark, and most people doubt the Soviets will ever allow a serious challenger to arise to their Top Dog position, but at least, most people say, we’re not going to have a nuclear war, right? The Soviets will never tolerate a new arms race…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[1] Even more absurd were the rumors as to the identity of the “mystery sub”: after all, rather than return the stolen ship, the Americans had blown it up and sunk it. They had even shown the wreckage to Soviet divers, who reported that it was indeed the Red October.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[2] Yes, I know this was OTL…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EPILOGUE: 2016&lt;br /&gt;June 17, an unusually large “science package” was launched into orbit from French Guyana. A high orbit, and a geostationary orbit. One that put it in line-of-sight of all but the northernmost parts of the USSR. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was unprecedented: various agreements between the EC and the USSR meant that each informed the other, in advance, about exactly what they were going to do with those ICBM-type things used to launch objects into space. The Soviets grumbled loudly, and turning telescopes on the science package and finding it unidentifiable, made noises about shooting it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tiny folded piece of paper covered with tiny scribbles made its way by various hands through the Soviet Union, from there to East Germany, and eventually to Western Europe. It arrived in America in February, 1987: too late, for those into whose hands it was finally delivered neither understood it nor believed its brief appeal. By the time it came to those who could confirm its reality, time had run out. Despairing, the original author of the note committed suicide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The US ambassador to the USSR at this point delivered certain papers to the Soviet government. Papers, he explained, relevant to the current situation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scribbles were soon copied more legibly. A small group of scientists in San Francisco studied them. Later a British businessman carried a copy of the paper and their additions back to Europe, where further work would be done. After 2005, the main area of activity would return to America, where the scattered biological components of what had been Sandia Labs returned to the looted shell of what had been one of the world’s primary research institutions. Stark Industries, a highly successful new high-tech startup, would prove a vital technological partner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By 2015, the only thing needed was a means to put a large payload into orbit. Certain behind the scenes negotiations began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soviet scientists examined the papers with care and increasing alarm. An emergency session of the Politburo was called.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;European and American scientists had substantially improved upon Ivan Vanko’s 1987 design: any Soviet missile launch would lead to the USSR being knocked back to the 19th century. For better or for worse, MAD was back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://t00.deviantart.net/7bVxov1uom6hoAR5vpagE8ksTog=/300x200/filters:fixed_height(100,100):origin()/pre00/f36b/th/pre/i/2012/079/0/0/amerika_2012_by_quantumbranching-d4tc6ok.png&quot; alt=&quot;thumbnail&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>            </item>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Last but definitely not least is our lovely British lady Lilian Crestmere, the proverbial dagger beneath England&amp;#8217;s table for decades she has more combat experience than just about any of us save immortals like Hecryn.&amp;nbsp; A mutant from a prestigious lineage of nobles she was destined for military service before her birth due to her family customs.&amp;nbsp; Her father a mutant and career military man and a knighted champion, he is head of the household and has been alive for five hundred years, likewise her mother was a daughter of the former Duke of Cornwall and a potent mage.&amp;nbsp; Frankly her blood couldn&amp;#8217;t be any bluer if you took a marker to it.&amp;nbsp; Despite that her family tradition states that the eldest join her majesty&amp;#8217;s army with no exception thus her fate when she reached enlistment age was sealed.&amp;nbsp; Her full mutant abilities manifested at age eight and when she was enlistment age she shapeshifted into male form and her father locked her in that form for a while and took away the rest of her post human abilities.&amp;nbsp; One would assume she&amp;#8217;d be packed off to some fancy officer&amp;#8217;s academy but instead she went in under an assumed alias (Ashley Winton) and had to work her way from the bottom.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basic physiology&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily despite being born on September 12th 1948 looks like a fit young british woman in her early twenties.&amp;nbsp; A lifetime on the front lines has given her a muscular build and a tolerance for bullshit in the negatives.&amp;nbsp; She is 5&amp;#8217;8&amp;#8221; 150lbs with light chestnut hair and bright green eyes, typically clad in whatever draws the least amount of attention and always carrying a concealable blade she always scans the area she&amp;#8217;s in for trouble.&amp;nbsp; She is far stronger, faster, and tougher than even the most well trained humans.&amp;nbsp; She can teleport, read and assault minds, utilize illusion magic, heal much quicker than humanly possible and is a preternaturally gifted markswoman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Skeletal structure&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In addition to her generally enhanced physiology Lily&amp;#8217;s skeletal structure is quite resilient.&amp;nbsp; Made of the same material as normal human skeletons it is also covered with a thin layer of a material I have yet to identify.&amp;nbsp; This not only renders it far stronger than an ordinary human skeleton but allows for the same range of motion.&amp;nbsp; Other than that her skeleton functions just the same as anyone else&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Muscular structure&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Muscles that allow someone to lift twenty five tons over their heads like lily&amp;#8217;s are serious business, Lily&amp;#8217;s muscles produce far fewer fatigue toxins allowing her to keep going for weeks before feeling any sort of fatigue.&amp;nbsp; She can run at well over two hundred miles per hour (but with little maneuverability) and her musculature allows for a great deal of flexibility as well.&amp;nbsp; She can twist and contort in various positions and hold them without hurting herself.&amp;nbsp; Her ligaments and tendons can stretch much farther than even the most well trained persons granting her a high degree of flexibility and resilience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Skin structure&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily&amp;#8217;s skin, other than its overall resilience bears no great difference to a regular persons, combined with her muscles and skeleton it confers C class resilience meaning that high caliber rounds at short range are the best option for engaging her, most ltl tech (tear gas, tasers and the like) has no effect on her whatsoever.&amp;nbsp; Anything below that just tends to piss her off and I can assure you no one wants her pissed off.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Immune system&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily&amp;#8217;s immune system is quite robust, I&amp;#8217;ve never seen her catch a cold or flu and more virulent diseases like cancer last about a day before she recovers.&amp;nbsp; She used to smoke a lot before opting for electronic cigarettes, the different flavors were far more appealing to her than nicotine addiction.&amp;nbsp; She can get drunk and be affected by drugs but it takes a far higher dose (.8 bal for her to get drunk and lethal doses of drugs for her to get high) She can endure a thousand times more radiation than a normal person can before suffering any radiation poisoning and temperature extremes mean little to her outside of a vacuum.&amp;nbsp; Even when inebriated she seems to be able to activate a sort of secondary immune system to flush out toxins and sober up in a matter of seconds.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Senses&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily&amp;#8217;s senses are supplemented by her telepathy allowing her to iron sight something from miles off and when combined with a sight can let her spot folks in complete darkness or otherwise obscured.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise her senses are peak human.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular system&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily&amp;#8217;s blood carries as much oxygen as anyone else, her body just makes much more efficient use of it.&amp;nbsp; She can function just fine in high altitude environments and her lungs can filter out any sort of nerve or chemical agent.&amp;nbsp; In truth chemical weapons just aggravate her immensely.&amp;nbsp; In addition her blood cells carry an advanced form of platelet that heals skin cells in seconds, torn muscles in minutes, and broken bones in hours (faster if she sets said bones).&amp;nbsp; She can also hold her breath for hours at a time minimizing her need for SCUBA gear in amphibious operations.&amp;nbsp; She (like serene) has far higher G tolerance than even the most well trained pilots.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nervous system&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily&amp;#8217;s nervous system is highly conductive giving her extreme hand eye coordination and reflexes.&amp;nbsp; She&amp;#8217;s fast enough to dodge gunfire, and is an extreme threat in CQC.&amp;nbsp; Of course this makes her an incredible shot even without using her other abilities.&amp;nbsp; Along with her training and unique physiology she can shut down the pain from grievous injuries to keep going for months at a time.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brain&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Being a telepath Lily has a highly developed limbic system, she&amp;#8217;s able to perceive emotions (both her own and others) far more clearly than even the most gifted interrogators.&amp;nbsp; She can supplant this to any of her normal five senses able to see, hear, touch, taste, and feel (tactile sense of course) emotion and thought.&amp;nbsp; The more powerful emotion the longer it lingers and some emotions are easier to find than others.&amp;nbsp; In addition she can stealth herself from telepathic inquiry, not so much a shield as an invisibility to telepathic detection as well as psychic invisibility.&amp;nbsp; In addition she possesses far greater 3-d situational awareness than most people, likely due to the fact she&amp;#8217;s a teleporter.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Career&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily has been a soldier since 1966 fresh out of army training she (or rather he at the time) was in an airborne army unit serving with the Australian parachute regiment during The Tet offensive.&amp;nbsp; It was during the battle of Kham Duc that her star truly shone.&amp;nbsp; She saved Captain John white of the 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; mobile strike force from a viet cong infiltrator, and in spite of the disaster that was kham duc she is credited with sniping an NVA commander outside of the city a shot from 2000 meters with a L1A1 self loading rifle.&amp;nbsp; This not only earned her several commendations but selection into the special air services.&amp;nbsp; However this was not before she saw action trying to hold the line during the Tet offensive where she is credited with saving hundreds of lives, her covering fire constantly peppering the Vietcong.&amp;nbsp; It was a tough decision for high command to lose such a sure shot but by the winter of 1968 she was on a plane back home to begin training with the SAS.&amp;nbsp; Taking the training even further she was trained as part of an elite unite of war mages known as the order of the orb.&amp;nbsp; The order of the orb or &amp;#8220;utility mages&amp;#8221; as they are more commonly known are a subset of british war mages well trained enough to contend with the rest of the worlds super soldiers.&amp;nbsp; The order of the orb focuses on utility magic spells and charms that aid their squads in battle by acting as a force multiplier or by misdirecting the enemy.&amp;nbsp; Lily showed great aptitude in a subset of lumiomancy that dealt with illusion magic.&amp;nbsp; Once her training was complete and it became clear that Vietnam was going to be unwinnable the powers that be decided she would be better utilized in Northern Ireland instead.&amp;nbsp; She was part of Operation Banner and from the parts of her record not completely obscured by black ink and mystic wards was involved in several operations against the most extreme branch of the Provisional IRA the Tuatha de Daunan famed for extreme secretarial violence, drawing high profile public support, and the public execution of &amp;#8220;collaborators&amp;#8221; to the British.&amp;nbsp; Despite her resourcefulness the Tuatha&amp;#8217;s popular support and growing campaign of violence against the English, &amp;#8220;unclean people&amp;#8221; and Irish protestants stretched her and her team to the limit.&amp;nbsp; Then on May 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1987 the tuatha carried out a bombing of the Chunnel resulting in several deaths among them the children of then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the children of several members of parliament.&amp;nbsp; This led to several events, first the provisional IRA cut any and all ties to the Tuatha and went to ground, second the british showed off one of their answers to nuclear proliferation throughout the world.&amp;nbsp; A week after the bombing forty challenger tanks appeared out of nowhere in Belfast and started leveling any building suspected of holding anyone associated with the IRA, minutes after that a full regiment of Royal Marines similarly appearing out of nowhere stormed every nook and cranny of northern Ireland killing or capturing any and all IRA members (or at that point anyone who looked at them sideways) in a campaign of rapid and often imprecise violence.&amp;nbsp; Lily and her team were deployed to the U.S. to ensure that stateside logistics were taken care of as well.&amp;nbsp; It was an operation that not only saw several remaining members of the state side IRA and the river rats and westies dead but a U.S. senator forcibly retired and then killed in the Adirondacks.&amp;nbsp; This operation among certain revelations of the U.S.&amp;#8217; conduct during Vietnam is credited among intelligence circles to the disbanding of NATO and the establishment of the European Federation and New Commonwealth formed by the U.K, Ireland, and Canada by 1989.&amp;nbsp; What remained of the IRA was rather eager to get into the peace process after the operation concluded deals were struck that included political concessions and prisoner exchange for reconstruction agreements.&amp;nbsp; A peaceable accord was likely brokered due to the threat of the Soviet Union and NATO&amp;#8217;s disbanding.&amp;nbsp; After the troubles started winding down Lily was reassigned to MI:6 whereupon the seal on her powers placed by her father failed.&amp;nbsp; Since her abilities are mutant and thus have a biological component she had to endure hours of agony as her body grew new tissue to accommodate her abilities.&amp;nbsp; A full investigation was conducted into her post human capabilities and MI:6 was quite pleased to have such a versatile and well trained asset at its disposal.&amp;nbsp; She was used to great effect in a number of operations across several countries in the U.S., U.S.S.R., European Federation, China, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, South Africa, Libya, and Mexico.&amp;nbsp; Through it all she was unquestioningly loyal, a vigilant shadow in her majestey&amp;#8217;s name and her father couldn&amp;#8217;t have been prouder.&amp;nbsp; However on a simple delivery mission to Saudi Arabia she saw something that changed her forever in the fall of 1992.&amp;nbsp; The mission was unusually straight forward, guard duty for a simple delivery but the details of the mission simply didn&amp;#8217;t add up.&amp;nbsp; Throughout her career she had been tasked with the most difficult, most impossible, most high level missions MI:6 could offer and now she was being tasked with guarding a tanker ship full of what the manifest claimed was &amp;#8220;miscellaneous goods&amp;#8221;.&amp;nbsp; Her handler was rather brusque about the mission as well insisting that she &amp;#8220;don&amp;#8217;t mind the details and just get the job done.&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp; Then there were the other security measures for the ship, telepathic jammers, teleportation scramblers, and a crew of thirty mercs armed with high tech melee weapons instead of guns was even more off putting.&amp;nbsp; Her skill in espionage led her to disable the jammers long enough to see what the cargo really was.&amp;nbsp; Mutant girls, all adolescent and implanted with cybernetic behavior regulators, with Afghanistan&amp;#8217;s fall and Iran joining the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. establishing a major presence in Isreal the rest of the Arab world wanted to enhance its standing superhuman forces, with the region&amp;#8217;s stance on magic being what it was combat mages were a no go but mutants on the other hand could be bred.&amp;nbsp; Whoever supplied these children (five hundred in all) also fitted them with cybernetic regulators to make them compliant and included medical faculties and equipment to maximize mutant birth rates.&amp;nbsp; Five hundred adolescent girls with a wide range of post human abilities were essentially sold into sexual slavery something Lily could not abide.&amp;nbsp; So Lily did the only thing she could do, she shot her handler twice in the head, twice in the chest and proceeded to systematically execute the rest of the security detail.&amp;nbsp; The mercs stood little chance against a solder with her experience and training, with her post human abilities it could scarcely be called a fight.&amp;nbsp; As the smoke cleared, and as she had just made herself an enemy of the state she started to consider her options, everything looked rather grim until one of the cargo containers burst open and out stepped a man who was number 3 on the world&amp;#8217;s most wanted list, Andrew Clay.&amp;nbsp; Clay said he had a plan to get the children to safety and thanks to contacting a group of folks dedicated to fighting human trafficking and exploitation was able to make good on his offer.&amp;nbsp; He managed to get the children to safety after a year of work, and then vowed to return to Saudi arabia to &amp;#8220;set things right&amp;#8221;.&amp;nbsp; With that Lily thought it would be best if she started running as by then she was surely blacklisted and placed at the top of MI:6&amp;#8217;s shit list.&amp;nbsp; Andrew made good on his promise to pay Saudi Arabia a visit and proceeded to incite a revolution that overthrew the monarchy and saw it replaced with a parliamentary body (more on that later).&amp;nbsp; She&amp;#8217;s been on the run since then and even after the world ended MI:6 (or rather what&amp;#8217;s left of it) is still intent on hunting her down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Skill set&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It should be noted that Lily has close to fifty years of combat experience before her powers were returned to her and training from some of the finest special forces the world has ever seen including but not limited to the Special Air Services, GIGN, Sheteyet 13, GSG9, GROM, EKO Cobra, Mossod, ASIS, DSGE, and Joint Task Force 2, MI6, MI5, and has extensive knowledge of CIA tactics and procedures. &amp;nbsp;She is a master when it comes to special operations and spycraft.&amp;nbsp; Though possessed of numerous skills (possessing a rating with anything that holds a bullet or a blade) she is a peerless sniper and demolitionist.&amp;nbsp; Years fighting the IRA led her to adopt their IED work into her own skills which she then refined throughout her career.&amp;nbsp; She is highly proficient (rating black E4) in Krav Maga an Israeli martial art that emphasizes bringing an opponent down as quickly and efficiently as possible.&amp;nbsp; She has worked extensively with Serene to further refine and hone her skill in krav maga, and combined with her superhuman attributes she can mow through groups of C+ to a single B rated super with little effort.&amp;nbsp; She is proficient in making IED&amp;#8217;s from spare parts and household items, something she picked up during operations in Northern Ireland.&amp;nbsp; She is fluent (conversational level) in several languages (Russian, Chinese, Spanish, Irish, Afrikans, French, German, Arabic, Farsi, Romanian, Croatian, Polish, Japanese, Urdu, Vietnamese, American sign language, military sign) and can affect several regional dialects.&amp;nbsp; She can bluff with the best of them thanks to years at MI:6, and is astoundingly resourceful.&amp;nbsp; In addition she is a talented illusionist both mundane and mystic means of misdirection are available to her. Insubstantial clones, invisibility, phantom sounds, lights, and obscuring mists are readily available to her with effort she can make sabotaged items look and function normally until she decides to release the glamour.&amp;nbsp; Once that&amp;#8217;s done object in question fails in a rather spectacular fashion, she normally saves this little trick for key parts of enemy infrastructure or equipment.&amp;nbsp; As a fully credited utility mage she can quick cast spells even in the midst of a fire fight.&amp;nbsp; In addition to helping her with krav maga, serene also helped refine her understanding of the street, the underworld and the art of the grift, Andrew and Anya taught her how to bolster her telepathic resistance, and I taught her the finer points of combat strategy.&amp;nbsp; She&amp;#8217;s a master at customizing firearms to expand its capabilities, all of her weapons bear her own customizations, fore grips, expanded magazines, custom stocks and sights are all part of her arsenal.&amp;nbsp; She is an expert in operating a variety of vehicles be it land, sea or air civilian or military.&amp;nbsp; She has an insane level of knowledge when it comes to firearms and ballistics knowing the exact specifications of every firearm on the planet.&amp;nbsp; Her expertise allows her to look at a bullet hole and tell what caliber bullet was used, the type of firearm used, the range it was fired at, the type of ammunition used, the modifications on the gun, and the skill of the shooter in a matter of seconds.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Power Set&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily has a diverse set of abilities that make her even more lethal than she already is.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;#8217;ve already explored her strength, speed, and durability so we can focus on her extra normal attributes.&amp;nbsp; It should be noted that lily only recently got her powers and hasn&amp;#8217;t been fully trained in them.&amp;nbsp; While they&amp;#8217;ve she needs proper training in order to fully exploit them something we haven&amp;#8217;t had time to do.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Telepathy&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily is a C+ level telepath, she is capable of reading minds, sensing minds, shorting synapses via telepathic attack, shielding herself from telepathic detection, and communicating directly with a mind.&amp;nbsp; She cannot control a person&amp;#8217;s thoughts or actions however so it&amp;#8217;s not a be all end all for recon.&amp;nbsp; She has an impressive radius of fifty miles, at max range she can read surface thoughts, half that she can read deeper into what folks prefer not to say out loud, she needs eye contact to plumb someone&amp;#8217;s subconscious.&amp;nbsp; She can tell if someone is under mystic geas or telepathic control as well.&amp;nbsp; Her telepathic attack works by direct stimulation of a targets pain centers, the resulting synaptic overload will incapacitate or kill even the hardiest of targets.&amp;nbsp; She has yet to learn how to dial her psychic attack down to incapacitate someone so this tends to be a backup option for her.&amp;nbsp; Her telepathy even lets her pick up uses of magic, or strong emotions left in an area fairly easily.&amp;nbsp; Though powerful her skill in telepathy is underdeveloped.&amp;nbsp; A weaker telepath of greater skill can elude or in some cases overwhelm her.&amp;nbsp; Though fairly safe from most mind control attempts a sufficiently powerful telepath can control her with considerable effort. Lilly is also capable of telepathic stealth rendering her undetectable to telepathic scans from all but the most powerful of telepaths. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Teleportation&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily is a C+ level teleporter giving her a range of fifty miles and preventing the worry of her ending up in something solid.&amp;nbsp; She can utilize her teleportation abilities offensively devastating living matter by displacing it forcibly.&amp;nbsp; She can take equipment and clothing with her, but not passengers so sadly she can&amp;#8217;t just extract people with a touch.&amp;nbsp; Her teleportation makes no sound, and produces no light show or any other sort of non standard phenomena.&amp;nbsp; She simply fades from view and then into view up to fifty miles elsewhere.&amp;nbsp; She doesn&amp;#8217;t even need line of sight to teleport, she describes it as fading away and having an overhead view of where she can go then she simply chooses to fade back in elsewhere.&amp;nbsp; However significant electromagnetic interference will prevent her teleportation ability, and offensive use of it requires total concentration preventing her from doing anything else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shapeshifting&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily is a C- shapeshifter able to alter her appearance, and shape but not mass.&amp;nbsp; She can fool guard dogs, visual inspection, retinal scans, fingerprints, but not DNA scanners.&amp;nbsp; She can&amp;#8217;t form natural weaponry like claws or fangs or the like either.&amp;nbsp; Nonetheless her shapeshifting abilities in addition to her training have let her infiltrate the most secure buildings.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hyper marksmanship&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily is capable of making any weapon she holds operate far above its standard operating capabilities. &amp;nbsp;She can make projectiles fly at around mach fifteen making them capable of tearing reinforced armor apart, curve them around cover, make innocuous items into impromptu homing weapons, shape explosives so they obliterate a single target instead of a group, intercept bullets in mid flight with her own bullets, increase the firing rate of a weapon tenfold, and perform even crazier stunts with them.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#8217;s a trademark for her and made her one of the most lethal soldiers of the twentieth and likely twenty first century.&amp;nbsp; She seems to accomplish this by charging whatever she&amp;#8217;s holding with a psychokinetic field that drastically alters how they interact with physical laws.&amp;nbsp; She can even double the clip size of any gun she wields by creating what I surmise are constructs of psionic energy that duplicates the rounds inside of the clip.&amp;nbsp; As per velocity and damage increase the bigger the round the more &amp;#8220;oomph&amp;#8221; she can put behind it this includes any weapon system she operates but if she puts too much energy in a round it goes off in her face with disastrous results.&amp;nbsp; Whenever she &amp;#8220;charges&amp;#8221; an object to break the laws of physics her eyes and whatever she&amp;#8217;s holding tend to arc with a silver electrical field depending on the amount of energy she&amp;#8217;s putting into something.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Combat&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Each of us have our own ways of dealing heaps of ultra violence on people, Serene has moves that make the matrix seem like amateur hour mcdajang &amp;#8220;karate&amp;#8221;, ED hits hard enough to red line the richter scale, Andrew will eat punches, stab wounds, bullets, and more and keep going, Anya looks like a ballerina or a whirlwind of claws and spikes, hecryn takes ridiculous risks that sees his enemies wind up as smears, I hit people when they can&amp;#8217;t see me and harder when they can, and Verick sits back and lets his minions do the work.&amp;nbsp; Lily can best be termed as &amp;#8220;anti climactic&amp;#8221; one to the head and move on is her style of combat, just brutal economy of motion in dispatching anyone stupid enough to take a shot at her.&amp;nbsp; Krav Maga, years of weapon training and her own superhuman attributes makes her practically capable of winning world war 3 on her own.&amp;nbsp; As part of a unit she&amp;#8217;s even more dangerous.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Personality&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It bears mentioning that ninety nine percent of human kind has no clue what this woman has been through.&amp;nbsp; Being at war for close to forty years has made her salty, terse, laconic, unapologetic, and plainspoken on leave.&amp;nbsp; She doesn&amp;#8217;t hold anything back no matter who she speaks to, unless she&amp;#8217;s working someone she has a difficult time relating with people.&amp;nbsp; She does have traces of warmth though, a soft spot for the honest working man or any generally decent folk despite being born and raised a blue blood.&amp;nbsp; The suffering of regular people under the thumb of the influential is something she has a major problem with and is likely why she chose to join us.&amp;nbsp; Add in a great deal of cynicism and you&amp;#8217;ve essentially got a porcupine with a heart of gold (and a concealed weapon somewhere on her person).&amp;nbsp; On mission lily is the epitome of cold calculating patience, as one of the best snipers on the planet she can wait for weeks, even month for the perfect opportunity to strike.&amp;nbsp; As per ethics Lily is essentially occam&amp;#8217;s razor when she&amp;#8217;s in a good mood, when she&amp;#8217;s pissed she&amp;#8217;ll find a way to make the offending party suffer for the rest of their lives.&amp;nbsp; She doesn&amp;#8217;t always kill a scumbag, she will cripple them though.&amp;nbsp; Lily has spent her years on the run from people she trusted, it makes her slow to open up to people but there&amp;#8217;s nothing more she values than a friend, which is sad considering how hard it is for her relate to most people.&amp;nbsp; A realist by nature she is often the one who points out the potential problems with our various plans and generally keeps our feet on the ground when we start getting too ambitious.&amp;nbsp; Lily may come off as an alcoholic with how much she drinks, but it simply takes way more alcohol to get her buzzed than a normal person.&amp;nbsp; That said she certainly does have a taste for beer, wine, and spirits and even brews her own sometimes though it tends to have quite a kick to it.&amp;nbsp; Lily believes in being prepared for anything, when she goes out she always has it in mind to blend with whatever the local populace is.&amp;nbsp; At any time she has a concealable blade, a flask (filled with water or booze) an E-cig, and playing cards.&amp;nbsp; Most of these items she keeps hidden via illusion magic.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tactical considerations&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily is part of the &amp;#8220;shadow ops&amp;#8221; of the Templar, she&amp;#8217;s normally in the field with Serene while Anya is on backup and I normally run ops.&amp;nbsp; She has decades of experience in special ops and spycraft so she is typically the field leader in any shadow op we have to run.&amp;nbsp; Both her and Serene can infiltrate just about anything, mark targets of opportunity and leave before anyone is the wiser.&amp;nbsp; They are both proficient at socially engineering folks to flip all but the most willful of personnel.&amp;nbsp; With her powers in addition to her training she&amp;#8217;s an extremely potent asset in any capacity.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Team Relations&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Niran &amp;#8220;serene&amp;#8221; Klahan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two of them working together are the best field agents any covert ops runner could ask for.&amp;nbsp; They can slip into any building or organization, map it, and under most circumstances get out.&amp;nbsp; She has been Niran&amp;#8217;s fuck buddy, confidant, and partner in crime.&amp;nbsp; The two of them and Anya like to stir up all sorts of trouble when on leave.&amp;nbsp; Niran and Lily are for lack of a more delicate term fuck buddies our work tends to invite loads of tension and we all have different ways of working it off.&amp;nbsp; Ed&amp;#8217;s a soulless killing machine, Verrick don&amp;#8217;t care, Andrew prays and meditates, Anya and hecryn have seen it all before but Niran and Lily well the fuck every now and again.&amp;nbsp; Frankly as long as it doesn&amp;#8217;t interfere with our mission it&amp;#8217;s all well and good.&amp;nbsp; Lily describes Niran&amp;#8217;s mind as open inviting and intoxicating like a fly trap the strength of his emotions and sensory input can trap an unwary visitor in his mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EOD01&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lily has an outlook of concern when it comes to ED in action, it&amp;#8217;s not every day you see someone use a whole sky scraper as a melee weapon or chuck a mountain.&amp;nbsp; She has described Ed&amp;#8217;s mind as &amp;#8220;simple, focused on survival more than anything else but there are some odd bits starting to show up.&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andrew Clay&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like all of us Lily thinks the world of Andrew, it was him that managed to get those mutant girls to safe homes instead of letting them become sex slaves.&amp;nbsp; She is determined to see Andrew&amp;#8217;s vision of a finer world come to pass, a world where people like her won&amp;#8217;t be necessary.&amp;nbsp; Lily describes andrew&amp;#8217;s mind as an overwhelmingly bright light.&amp;nbsp; Like staring point blank into a quasar with a choral chant of infinite volume.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Verrick Bulat&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not every day one gets to work with someone with a kill count that would make Hiencrich Himmler jealous.&amp;nbsp; Verrick is a monster and Lily knows it, hell we all know it but he&amp;#8217;s indispensible to our stratagems so we tolerate him.&amp;nbsp; The actions of Verricks empire hit Lily closer than any of us since her old man actually fought Verricks armies back in the day.&amp;nbsp; Verrick for his part thinks of Lily as one more weapon to be utilized though his attitude is softening.&amp;nbsp; Verricks mind has been described as sinister beyond imagining a primordial darkness that invokes terrors long forgotten in the mind of any who visit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hecryn&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lily&amp;#8217;s drinking buddy and smoking partner, you&amp;#8217;d think they&amp;#8217;d be fucking on a regular basis but fucking seems to be the furthest thing from either of their minds when they get together.&amp;nbsp; They compare scars, missions, tactics, and more.&amp;nbsp; Lily taught Hecryn how to use guns, and Hecryn instructed Lily in swordplay and archery which is far more useful than one would think.&amp;nbsp; In spite of how he conducts himself on and off the battlefield lily describes hecryns mind as constantly weighing options and risks.&amp;nbsp; Almost like a calculator.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hector&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We get each other, plain and simple she was SAS I was Delta we both are cut from the same cloth.&amp;nbsp; Athena has some foolish idea that I have feelings for her but frankly its absurd.&amp;nbsp; Lily is an asset and team member and she sees me the same way.&amp;nbsp; We have a job to do, and a damn worthwhile one too, I can put my heart on hold to see this thing through and so can she.&amp;nbsp; She describes my mind as simple at first glance but with countless facets and paths beneath the surface.&amp;nbsp; She says it&amp;#8217;s fascinating to see it in action it&amp;#8217;s flattering I guess.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anya&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I had a shot for every time I heard &amp;#8220;Fuck&amp;#8217;s sake Anya get your sodding tits off the back of my head you knob&amp;#8221; it would likely overwhelm my synthetic parts and cause me to shut down.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Anya likes to play little &amp;#8220;pranks&amp;#8221; on Lily and considering the world&amp;#8217;s most dangerous predator going up against the world&amp;#8217;s most well trained soldier makes for some classic fucking theatre.&amp;nbsp; They have this weird little relationship where one minute they&amp;#8217;re bickering like kids and the next they&amp;#8217;re in lock step with each other.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#8217;ve got dozens of PHD&amp;#8217;s and doctorates, an augmented reality display that can make micro expressions as plain as day, and years of experience profiling folks, but damned if I can figure that shit out.&amp;nbsp; Lily says anya&amp;#8217;s mind is like a child at play, even when she&amp;#8217;s ripping someone in half.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Equipment&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily has a number of guns and other assorted weaponry at her disposal, she favors function over modern tech so she only uses a few modern firearms.&amp;nbsp; She has eschewed modern charge weaponry for more familiar ballistics by and large.&amp;nbsp; The most used items in her arsenal are listed below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Accuracy international A.W. 50&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A lovingly customized sniper rifle that pitches .50 BMG rounds at astonishing velocity, Lily has customized the rifle to convert it to a semi automatic configuration instead of the bolt action.&amp;nbsp; Enchantments in the chamber touches the propellant causing them to burn more completely and expand smoother resulting in a much higher muzzle velocity.&amp;nbsp; The sight is a british technomancy innovation known as a &amp;#8220;Willow wisp&amp;#8221; sight.&amp;nbsp; This nifty gadget can see living things through solid matter and instantly analyzes a person&amp;#8217;s vital organs.&amp;nbsp; The magazine has been expanded as well holding ten rounds instead of the normal five.&amp;nbsp; An ingenious system of structural braces further dampens the already minimal recoil and another system of enchantments eliminates noise and muzzle flare.&amp;nbsp; The final enchantment on the gun allows the bullets to phase through solid inorganic matter and slide right into the squishy person underneath or behind.&amp;nbsp; The bullet will only phase through an inch of solid matter, after that physics takes over.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SA80E&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A venerable model of British assault rifle the SA80E is being phased out in favor of newer models.&amp;nbsp; The SA80E is a jack of all trades assault rifle, but with lily&amp;#8217;s modifications it truly shines.&amp;nbsp; The foregrip and collapsible stock makes it very controllable in even the tightest of spaces further taking advantage of its bullpup design, and the reflex sight makes it ideally suited for close to mid range engagements.&amp;nbsp; Enchantments take hop up and recoil out of the gun and the expanded magazine allows for longer engagements.&amp;nbsp; The other enchantments and mechanical enhancements make the gun more rugged and robust able to take incredible abuse and punishment while operating perfectly.&amp;nbsp; She normally keeps a magazine on the rail and several combi magazines as well.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neosted 2000 c&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A compact magazine fed shotgun originating from South Africa lily has modified it extensively to pack even more of a punch than a normal shotgun.&amp;nbsp; This thing is not subtle every enchantment is centered around generating terrific muzzle velocity and impact force.&amp;nbsp; The enhanced force behind it requires someone with at least D rank strength to use one handed.&amp;nbsp; She has reinforced the weapon to withstand the force of the weapons recoil.&amp;nbsp; She keeps all manner of ammunition around for it as well, flechette, breaching, solid slug, rock salt, dragons breath, and so forth.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sig saur p226&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Wielded alone with an extended magazine this is essentially lily&amp;#8217;s last resort firearm.&amp;nbsp; Enchanted to eliminate noise and muzzle flash and reinforced to withstand being used as a bludgeon and endure all manner of environments these are essentially the old faithful of lilly&amp;#8217;s armory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compound bow&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It seems out of place for Lily to have a bow and arrow in her arsenal unless you consider the advantages a bow has, completely silent without magic or extra equipment, and retrievable ammo are still something firearms can&amp;#8217;t do.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore some things just laugh when they get tiny little holes punched in them.&amp;nbsp; Lily&amp;#8217;s bow has been modified to take advantage of her strength, the bow has a ten ton draw strength and is enchanted to bestow its arrows with a means to silence the sonic boom they cause when they fly as fast as they do.&amp;nbsp; The result of these arrows hitting someone is like watching princess mononoke.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GE M134 minigun&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; No subtlety here just good old American opposite of subtlety, enchanted to redirect heat into thermovoltaic cells the gun can fire ad nauseum as long as it has ammunition.&amp;nbsp; She has it belt fed and has a back pack unit that has been extensively modified to store ammunition extra dimensionally.&amp;nbsp; The backpack can hold ten thousand rounds at any given time before having to call upon more.&amp;nbsp; The rest of the ammunition is stored extra dimensionally and reloading the entire backpack unit takes thirty miniutes between full firing cycles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Type 6 Rifle Resistant armor&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Commissioned from the European Federtion&amp;#8217;s Lux Omnia Vinci initiative as a reward for helping secure some rather elusive assets this rifle resistant armor doesn&amp;#8217;t stop bullets at all.&amp;nbsp; Using light manipulation technology the armor essentially baffles the perception of any around this has two benefits.&amp;nbsp; One it bestows a sort of psychic invisibility meaning everyone simply looks past or ignores her when she wears it.&amp;nbsp; Two when found the armor lets loose a sort of chaff that works on multiple modes of perception.&amp;nbsp; Sight, smell, hearing, even more exotic forms of detection are baffled subtly making would be gunmen or assailants miss by mere inches.&amp;nbsp; As anything more would immediately put an experienced shooter on guard and lead them to adjust their aim the wearer must still intelligently utilize cover to maximize the armor system&amp;#8217;s effectiveness.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Khonshu Tactical Hood&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A tactical hood that scrambles any facial recognition, thermal or x ray cam, or scrying and psychomancy attempts.&amp;nbsp; It also warps the wearer&amp;#8217;s voice into something exceedingly menacing, projecting dominance and making even the most resolute gunmen lose their focus and their nerve.&amp;nbsp; The mask also lets the wearer see as if he or she is in a well lit room and can eliminate the obscuring affects of gas or fog.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mountain man Camel back&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Capable of holding ten liters of water in an extra dimensional space taking a good deal of weight off of the soldier, it is enchanted to keep the liquid cold.&amp;nbsp; Nine times out of ten instead of water the camelback holds a sort of witch&amp;#8217;s brew made by Commonwealth Apothecaries.&amp;nbsp; A liter can keep a soldier fed and hydrated for a whole day, special forces operators get a more potent variation of the brew called a soldier&amp;#8217;s draught that gives them the benefit with just a sip.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Variations exist for different climates and aid a soldier immensely in survival situations.&amp;nbsp; In addition the brew can be poured on the skin to serve as a salve and disinfectant, and can purify rotten food.&amp;nbsp;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Invictus file 8 Lilian Ivy Crestmere&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Last but definitely not least is our lovely British lady Lilian Crestmere, the proverbial dagger beneath England&amp;#8217;s table for decades she has more combat experience than just about any of us save immortals like Hecryn.&amp;nbsp; A mutant from a prestigious lineage of nobles she was destined for military service before her birth due to her family customs.&amp;nbsp; Her father a mutant and career military man and a knighted champion, he is head of the household and has been alive for five hundred years, likewise her mother was a daughter of the former Duke of Cornwall and a potent mage.&amp;nbsp; Frankly her blood couldn&amp;#8217;t be any bluer if you took a marker to it.&amp;nbsp; Despite that her family tradition states that the eldest join her majesty&amp;#8217;s army with no exception thus her fate when she reached enlistment age was sealed.&amp;nbsp; Her full mutant abilities manifested at age eight and when she was enlistment age she shapeshifted into male form and her father locked her in that form for a while and took away the rest of her post human abilities.&amp;nbsp; One would assume she&amp;#8217;d be packed off to some fancy officer&amp;#8217;s academy but instead she went in under an assumed alias (Ashley Winton) and had to work her way from the bottom.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basic physiology&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily despite being born on September 12th 1948 looks like a fit young british woman in her early twenties.&amp;nbsp; A lifetime on the front lines has given her a muscular build and a tolerance for bullshit in the negatives.&amp;nbsp; She is 5&amp;#8217;8&amp;#8221; 150lbs with light chestnut hair and bright green eyes, typically clad in whatever draws the least amount of attention and always carrying a concealable blade she always scans the area she&amp;#8217;s in for trouble.&amp;nbsp; She is far stronger, faster, and tougher than even the most well trained humans.&amp;nbsp; She can teleport, read and assault minds, utilize illusion magic, heal much quicker than humanly possible and is a preternaturally gifted markswoman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Skeletal structure&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In addition to her generally enhanced physiology Lily&amp;#8217;s skeletal structure is quite resilient.&amp;nbsp; Made of the same material as normal human skeletons it is also covered with a thin layer of a material I have yet to identify.&amp;nbsp; This not only renders it far stronger than an ordinary human skeleton but allows for the same range of motion.&amp;nbsp; Other than that her skeleton functions just the same as anyone else&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Muscular structure&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Muscles that allow someone to lift twenty five tons over their heads like lily&amp;#8217;s are serious business, Lily&amp;#8217;s muscles produce far fewer fatigue toxins allowing her to keep going for weeks before feeling any sort of fatigue.&amp;nbsp; She can run at well over two hundred miles per hour (but with little maneuverability) and her musculature allows for a great deal of flexibility as well.&amp;nbsp; She can twist and contort in various positions and hold them without hurting herself.&amp;nbsp; Her ligaments and tendons can stretch much farther than even the most well trained persons granting her a high degree of flexibility and resilience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Skin structure&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily&amp;#8217;s skin, other than its overall resilience bears no great difference to a regular persons, combined with her muscles and skeleton it confers C class resilience meaning that high caliber rounds at short range are the best option for engaging her, most ltl tech (tear gas, tasers and the like) has no effect on her whatsoever.&amp;nbsp; Anything below that just tends to piss her off and I can assure you no one wants her pissed off.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Immune system&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily&amp;#8217;s immune system is quite robust, I&amp;#8217;ve never seen her catch a cold or flu and more virulent diseases like cancer last about a day before she recovers.&amp;nbsp; She used to smoke a lot before opting for electronic cigarettes, the different flavors were far more appealing to her than nicotine addiction.&amp;nbsp; She can get drunk and be affected by drugs but it takes a far higher dose (.8 bal for her to get drunk and lethal doses of drugs for her to get high) She can endure a thousand times more radiation than a normal person can before suffering any radiation poisoning and temperature extremes mean little to her outside of a vacuum.&amp;nbsp; Even when inebriated she seems to be able to activate a sort of secondary immune system to flush out toxins and sober up in a matter of seconds.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Senses&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily&amp;#8217;s senses are supplemented by her telepathy allowing her to iron sight something from miles off and when combined with a sight can let her spot folks in complete darkness or otherwise obscured.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise her senses are peak human.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular system&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily&amp;#8217;s blood carries as much oxygen as anyone else, her body just makes much more efficient use of it.&amp;nbsp; She can function just fine in high altitude environments and her lungs can filter out any sort of nerve or chemical agent.&amp;nbsp; In truth chemical weapons just aggravate her immensely.&amp;nbsp; In addition her blood cells carry an advanced form of platelet that heals skin cells in seconds, torn muscles in minutes, and broken bones in hours (faster if she sets said bones).&amp;nbsp; She can also hold her breath for hours at a time minimizing her need for SCUBA gear in amphibious operations.&amp;nbsp; She (like serene) has far higher G tolerance than even the most well trained pilots.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nervous system&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily&amp;#8217;s nervous system is highly conductive giving her extreme hand eye coordination and reflexes.&amp;nbsp; She&amp;#8217;s fast enough to dodge gunfire, and is an extreme threat in CQC.&amp;nbsp; Of course this makes her an incredible shot even without using her other abilities.&amp;nbsp; Along with her training and unique physiology she can shut down the pain from grievous injuries to keep going for months at a time.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brain&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Being a telepath Lily has a highly developed limbic system, she&amp;#8217;s able to perceive emotions (both her own and others) far more clearly than even the most gifted interrogators.&amp;nbsp; She can supplant this to any of her normal five senses able to see, hear, touch, taste, and feel (tactile sense of course) emotion and thought.&amp;nbsp; The more powerful emotion the longer it lingers and some emotions are easier to find than others.&amp;nbsp; In addition she can stealth herself from telepathic inquiry, not so much a shield as an invisibility to telepathic detection as well as psychic invisibility.&amp;nbsp; In addition she possesses far greater 3-d situational awareness than most people, likely due to the fact she&amp;#8217;s a teleporter.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Career&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily has been a soldier since 1966 fresh out of army training she (or rather he at the time) was in an airborne army unit serving with the Australian parachute regiment during The Tet offensive.&amp;nbsp; It was during the battle of Kham Duc that her star truly shone.&amp;nbsp; She saved Captain John white of the 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; mobile strike force from a viet cong infiltrator, and in spite of the disaster that was kham duc she is credited with sniping an NVA commander outside of the city a shot from 2000 meters with a L1A1 self loading rifle.&amp;nbsp; This not only earned her several commendations but selection into the special air services.&amp;nbsp; However this was not before she saw action trying to hold the line during the Tet offensive where she is credited with saving hundreds of lives, her covering fire constantly peppering the Vietcong.&amp;nbsp; It was a tough decision for high command to lose such a sure shot but by the winter of 1968 she was on a plane back home to begin training with the SAS.&amp;nbsp; Taking the training even further she was trained as part of an elite unite of war mages known as the order of the orb.&amp;nbsp; The order of the orb or &amp;#8220;utility mages&amp;#8221; as they are more commonly known are a subset of british war mages well trained enough to contend with the rest of the worlds super soldiers.&amp;nbsp; The order of the orb focuses on utility magic spells and charms that aid their squads in battle by acting as a force multiplier or by misdirecting the enemy.&amp;nbsp; Lily showed great aptitude in a subset of lumiomancy that dealt with illusion magic.&amp;nbsp; Once her training was complete and it became clear that Vietnam was going to be unwinnable the powers that be decided she would be better utilized in Northern Ireland instead.&amp;nbsp; She was part of Operation Banner and from the parts of her record not completely obscured by black ink and mystic wards was involved in several operations against the most extreme branch of the Provisional IRA the Tuatha de Daunan famed for extreme secretarial violence, drawing high profile public support, and the public execution of &amp;#8220;collaborators&amp;#8221; to the British.&amp;nbsp; Despite her resourcefulness the Tuatha&amp;#8217;s popular support and growing campaign of violence against the English, &amp;#8220;unclean people&amp;#8221; and Irish protestants stretched her and her team to the limit.&amp;nbsp; Then on May 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1987 the tuatha carried out a bombing of the Chunnel resulting in several deaths among them the children of then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the children of several members of parliament.&amp;nbsp; This led to several events, first the provisional IRA cut any and all ties to the Tuatha and went to ground, second the british showed off one of their answers to nuclear proliferation throughout the world.&amp;nbsp; A week after the bombing forty challenger tanks appeared out of nowhere in Belfast and started leveling any building suspected of holding anyone associated with the IRA, minutes after that a full regiment of Royal Marines similarly appearing out of nowhere stormed every nook and cranny of northern Ireland killing or capturing any and all IRA members (or at that point anyone who looked at them sideways) in a campaign of rapid and often imprecise violence.&amp;nbsp; Lily and her team were deployed to the U.S. to ensure that stateside logistics were taken care of as well.&amp;nbsp; It was an operation that not only saw several remaining members of the state side IRA and the river rats and westies dead but a U.S. senator forcibly retired and then killed in the Adirondacks.&amp;nbsp; This operation among certain revelations of the U.S.&amp;#8217; conduct during Vietnam is credited among intelligence circles to the disbanding of NATO and the establishment of the European Federation and New Commonwealth formed by the U.K, Ireland, and Canada by 1989.&amp;nbsp; What remained of the IRA was rather eager to get into the peace process after the operation concluded deals were struck that included political concessions and prisoner exchange for reconstruction agreements.&amp;nbsp; A peaceable accord was likely brokered due to the threat of the Soviet Union and NATO&amp;#8217;s disbanding.&amp;nbsp; After the troubles started winding down Lily was reassigned to MI:6 whereupon the seal on her powers placed by her father failed.&amp;nbsp; Since her abilities are mutant and thus have a biological component she had to endure hours of agony as her body grew new tissue to accommodate her abilities.&amp;nbsp; A full investigation was conducted into her post human capabilities and MI:6 was quite pleased to have such a versatile and well trained asset at its disposal.&amp;nbsp; She was used to great effect in a number of operations across several countries in the U.S., U.S.S.R., European Federation, China, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, South Africa, Libya, and Mexico.&amp;nbsp; Through it all she was unquestioningly loyal, a vigilant shadow in her majestey&amp;#8217;s name and her father couldn&amp;#8217;t have been prouder.&amp;nbsp; However on a simple delivery mission to Saudi Arabia she saw something that changed her forever in the fall of 1992.&amp;nbsp; The mission was unusually straight forward, guard duty for a simple delivery but the details of the mission simply didn&amp;#8217;t add up.&amp;nbsp; Throughout her career she had been tasked with the most difficult, most impossible, most high level missions MI:6 could offer and now she was being tasked with guarding a tanker ship full of what the manifest claimed was &amp;#8220;miscellaneous goods&amp;#8221;.&amp;nbsp; Her handler was rather brusque about the mission as well insisting that she &amp;#8220;don&amp;#8217;t mind the details and just get the job done.&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp; Then there were the other security measures for the ship, telepathic jammers, teleportation scramblers, and a crew of thirty mercs armed with high tech melee weapons instead of guns was even more off putting.&amp;nbsp; Her skill in espionage led her to disable the jammers long enough to see what the cargo really was.&amp;nbsp; Mutant girls, all adolescent and implanted with cybernetic behavior regulators, with Afghanistan&amp;#8217;s fall and Iran joining the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. establishing a major presence in Isreal the rest of the Arab world wanted to enhance its standing superhuman forces, with the region&amp;#8217;s stance on magic being what it was combat mages were a no go but mutants on the other hand could be bred.&amp;nbsp; Whoever supplied these children (five hundred in all) also fitted them with cybernetic regulators to make them compliant and included medical faculties and equipment to maximize mutant birth rates.&amp;nbsp; Five hundred adolescent girls with a wide range of post human abilities were essentially sold into sexual slavery something Lily could not abide.&amp;nbsp; So Lily did the only thing she could do, she shot her handler twice in the head, twice in the chest and proceeded to systematically execute the rest of the security detail.&amp;nbsp; The mercs stood little chance against a solder with her experience and training, with her post human abilities it could scarcely be called a fight.&amp;nbsp; As the smoke cleared, and as she had just made herself an enemy of the state she started to consider her options, everything looked rather grim until one of the cargo containers burst open and out stepped a man who was number 3 on the world&amp;#8217;s most wanted list, Andrew Clay.&amp;nbsp; Clay said he had a plan to get the children to safety and thanks to contacting a group of folks dedicated to fighting human trafficking and exploitation was able to make good on his offer.&amp;nbsp; He managed to get the children to safety after a year of work, and then vowed to return to Saudi arabia to &amp;#8220;set things right&amp;#8221;.&amp;nbsp; With that Lily thought it would be best if she started running as by then she was surely blacklisted and placed at the top of MI:6&amp;#8217;s shit list.&amp;nbsp; Andrew made good on his promise to pay Saudi Arabia a visit and proceeded to incite a revolution that overthrew the monarchy and saw it replaced with a parliamentary body (more on that later).&amp;nbsp; She&amp;#8217;s been on the run since then and even after the world ended MI:6 (or rather what&amp;#8217;s left of it) is still intent on hunting her down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Skill set&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It should be noted that Lily has close to fifty years of combat experience before her powers were returned to her and training from some of the finest special forces the world has ever seen including but not limited to the Special Air Services, GIGN, Sheteyet 13, GSG9, GROM, EKO Cobra, Mossod, ASIS, DSGE, and Joint Task Force 2, MI6, MI5, and has extensive knowledge of CIA tactics and procedures. &amp;nbsp;She is a master when it comes to special operations and spycraft.&amp;nbsp; Though possessed of numerous skills (possessing a rating with anything that holds a bullet or a blade) she is a peerless sniper and demolitionist.&amp;nbsp; Years fighting the IRA led her to adopt their IED work into her own skills which she then refined throughout her career.&amp;nbsp; She is highly proficient (rating black E4) in Krav Maga an Israeli martial art that emphasizes bringing an opponent down as quickly and efficiently as possible.&amp;nbsp; She has worked extensively with Serene to further refine and hone her skill in krav maga, and combined with her superhuman attributes she can mow through groups of C+ to a single B rated super with little effort.&amp;nbsp; She is proficient in making IED&amp;#8217;s from spare parts and household items, something she picked up during operations in Northern Ireland.&amp;nbsp; She is fluent (conversational level) in several languages (Russian, Chinese, Spanish, Irish, Afrikans, French, German, Arabic, Farsi, Romanian, Croatian, Polish, Japanese, Urdu, Vietnamese, American sign language, military sign) and can affect several regional dialects.&amp;nbsp; She can bluff with the best of them thanks to years at MI:6, and is astoundingly resourceful.&amp;nbsp; In addition she is a talented illusionist both mundane and mystic means of misdirection are available to her. Insubstantial clones, invisibility, phantom sounds, lights, and obscuring mists are readily available to her with effort she can make sabotaged items look and function normally until she decides to release the glamour.&amp;nbsp; Once that&amp;#8217;s done object in question fails in a rather spectacular fashion, she normally saves this little trick for key parts of enemy infrastructure or equipment.&amp;nbsp; As a fully credited utility mage she can quick cast spells even in the midst of a fire fight.&amp;nbsp; In addition to helping her with krav maga, serene also helped refine her understanding of the street, the underworld and the art of the grift, Andrew and Anya taught her how to bolster her telepathic resistance, and I taught her the finer points of combat strategy.&amp;nbsp; She&amp;#8217;s a master at customizing firearms to expand its capabilities, all of her weapons bear her own customizations, fore grips, expanded magazines, custom stocks and sights are all part of her arsenal.&amp;nbsp; She is an expert in operating a variety of vehicles be it land, sea or air civilian or military.&amp;nbsp; She has an insane level of knowledge when it comes to firearms and ballistics knowing the exact specifications of every firearm on the planet.&amp;nbsp; Her expertise allows her to look at a bullet hole and tell what caliber bullet was used, the type of firearm used, the range it was fired at, the type of ammunition used, the modifications on the gun, and the skill of the shooter in a matter of seconds.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Power Set&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily has a diverse set of abilities that make her even more lethal than she already is.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;#8217;ve already explored her strength, speed, and durability so we can focus on her extra normal attributes.&amp;nbsp; It should be noted that lily only recently got her powers and hasn&amp;#8217;t been fully trained in them.&amp;nbsp; While they&amp;#8217;ve she needs proper training in order to fully exploit them something we haven&amp;#8217;t had time to do.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Telepathy&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily is a C+ level telepath, she is capable of reading minds, sensing minds, shorting synapses via telepathic attack, shielding herself from telepathic detection, and communicating directly with a mind.&amp;nbsp; She cannot control a person&amp;#8217;s thoughts or actions however so it&amp;#8217;s not a be all end all for recon.&amp;nbsp; She has an impressive radius of fifty miles, at max range she can read surface thoughts, half that she can read deeper into what folks prefer not to say out loud, she needs eye contact to plumb someone&amp;#8217;s subconscious.&amp;nbsp; She can tell if someone is under mystic geas or telepathic control as well.&amp;nbsp; Her telepathic attack works by direct stimulation of a targets pain centers, the resulting synaptic overload will incapacitate or kill even the hardiest of targets.&amp;nbsp; She has yet to learn how to dial her psychic attack down to incapacitate someone so this tends to be a backup option for her.&amp;nbsp; Her telepathy even lets her pick up uses of magic, or strong emotions left in an area fairly easily.&amp;nbsp; Though powerful her skill in telepathy is underdeveloped.&amp;nbsp; A weaker telepath of greater skill can elude or in some cases overwhelm her.&amp;nbsp; Though fairly safe from most mind control attempts a sufficiently powerful telepath can control her with considerable effort. Lilly is also capable of telepathic stealth rendering her undetectable to telepathic scans from all but the most powerful of telepaths. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Teleportation&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily is a C+ level teleporter giving her a range of fifty miles and preventing the worry of her ending up in something solid.&amp;nbsp; She can utilize her teleportation abilities offensively devastating living matter by displacing it forcibly.&amp;nbsp; She can take equipment and clothing with her, but not passengers so sadly she can&amp;#8217;t just extract people with a touch.&amp;nbsp; Her teleportation makes no sound, and produces no light show or any other sort of non standard phenomena.&amp;nbsp; She simply fades from view and then into view up to fifty miles elsewhere.&amp;nbsp; She doesn&amp;#8217;t even need line of sight to teleport, she describes it as fading away and having an overhead view of where she can go then she simply chooses to fade back in elsewhere.&amp;nbsp; However significant electromagnetic interference will prevent her teleportation ability, and offensive use of it requires total concentration preventing her from doing anything else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shapeshifting&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily is a C- shapeshifter able to alter her appearance, and shape but not mass.&amp;nbsp; She can fool guard dogs, visual inspection, retinal scans, fingerprints, but not DNA scanners.&amp;nbsp; She can&amp;#8217;t form natural weaponry like claws or fangs or the like either.&amp;nbsp; Nonetheless her shapeshifting abilities in addition to her training have let her infiltrate the most secure buildings.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hyper marksmanship&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily is capable of making any weapon she holds operate far above its standard operating capabilities. &amp;nbsp;She can make projectiles fly at around mach fifteen making them capable of tearing reinforced armor apart, curve them around cover, make innocuous items into impromptu homing weapons, shape explosives so they obliterate a single target instead of a group, intercept bullets in mid flight with her own bullets, increase the firing rate of a weapon tenfold, and perform even crazier stunts with them.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#8217;s a trademark for her and made her one of the most lethal soldiers of the twentieth and likely twenty first century.&amp;nbsp; She seems to accomplish this by charging whatever she&amp;#8217;s holding with a psychokinetic field that drastically alters how they interact with physical laws.&amp;nbsp; She can even double the clip size of any gun she wields by creating what I surmise are constructs of psionic energy that duplicates the rounds inside of the clip.&amp;nbsp; As per velocity and damage increase the bigger the round the more &amp;#8220;oomph&amp;#8221; she can put behind it this includes any weapon system she operates but if she puts too much energy in a round it goes off in her face with disastrous results.&amp;nbsp; Whenever she &amp;#8220;charges&amp;#8221; an object to break the laws of physics her eyes and whatever she&amp;#8217;s holding tend to arc with a silver electrical field depending on the amount of energy she&amp;#8217;s putting into something.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Combat&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Each of us have our own ways of dealing heaps of ultra violence on people, Serene has moves that make the matrix seem like amateur hour mcdajang &amp;#8220;karate&amp;#8221;, ED hits hard enough to red line the richter scale, Andrew will eat punches, stab wounds, bullets, and more and keep going, Anya looks like a ballerina or a whirlwind of claws and spikes, hecryn takes ridiculous risks that sees his enemies wind up as smears, I hit people when they can&amp;#8217;t see me and harder when they can, and Verick sits back and lets his minions do the work.&amp;nbsp; Lily can best be termed as &amp;#8220;anti climactic&amp;#8221; one to the head and move on is her style of combat, just brutal economy of motion in dispatching anyone stupid enough to take a shot at her.&amp;nbsp; Krav Maga, years of weapon training and her own superhuman attributes makes her practically capable of winning world war 3 on her own.&amp;nbsp; As part of a unit she&amp;#8217;s even more dangerous.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Personality&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It bears mentioning that ninety nine percent of human kind has no clue what this woman has been through.&amp;nbsp; Being at war for close to forty years has made her salty, terse, laconic, unapologetic, and plainspoken on leave.&amp;nbsp; She doesn&amp;#8217;t hold anything back no matter who she speaks to, unless she&amp;#8217;s working someone she has a difficult time relating with people.&amp;nbsp; She does have traces of warmth though, a soft spot for the honest working man or any generally decent folk despite being born and raised a blue blood.&amp;nbsp; The suffering of regular people under the thumb of the influential is something she has a major problem with and is likely why she chose to join us.&amp;nbsp; Add in a great deal of cynicism and you&amp;#8217;ve essentially got a porcupine with a heart of gold (and a concealed weapon somewhere on her person).&amp;nbsp; On mission lily is the epitome of cold calculating patience, as one of the best snipers on the planet she can wait for weeks, even month for the perfect opportunity to strike.&amp;nbsp; As per ethics Lily is essentially occam&amp;#8217;s razor when she&amp;#8217;s in a good mood, when she&amp;#8217;s pissed she&amp;#8217;ll find a way to make the offending party suffer for the rest of their lives.&amp;nbsp; She doesn&amp;#8217;t always kill a scumbag, she will cripple them though.&amp;nbsp; Lily has spent her years on the run from people she trusted, it makes her slow to open up to people but there&amp;#8217;s nothing more she values than a friend, which is sad considering how hard it is for her relate to most people.&amp;nbsp; A realist by nature she is often the one who points out the potential problems with our various plans and generally keeps our feet on the ground when we start getting too ambitious.&amp;nbsp; Lily may come off as an alcoholic with how much she drinks, but it simply takes way more alcohol to get her buzzed than a normal person.&amp;nbsp; That said she certainly does have a taste for beer, wine, and spirits and even brews her own sometimes though it tends to have quite a kick to it.&amp;nbsp; Lily believes in being prepared for anything, when she goes out she always has it in mind to blend with whatever the local populace is.&amp;nbsp; At any time she has a concealable blade, a flask (filled with water or booze) an E-cig, and playing cards.&amp;nbsp; Most of these items she keeps hidden via illusion magic.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tactical considerations&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily is part of the &amp;#8220;shadow ops&amp;#8221; of the Templar, she&amp;#8217;s normally in the field with Serene while Anya is on backup and I normally run ops.&amp;nbsp; She has decades of experience in special ops and spycraft so she is typically the field leader in any shadow op we have to run.&amp;nbsp; Both her and Serene can infiltrate just about anything, mark targets of opportunity and leave before anyone is the wiser.&amp;nbsp; They are both proficient at socially engineering folks to flip all but the most willful of personnel.&amp;nbsp; With her powers in addition to her training she&amp;#8217;s an extremely potent asset in any capacity.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Team Relations&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Niran &amp;#8220;serene&amp;#8221; Klahan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two of them working together are the best field agents any covert ops runner could ask for.&amp;nbsp; They can slip into any building or organization, map it, and under most circumstances get out.&amp;nbsp; She has been Niran&amp;#8217;s fuck buddy, confidant, and partner in crime.&amp;nbsp; The two of them and Anya like to stir up all sorts of trouble when on leave.&amp;nbsp; Niran and Lily are for lack of a more delicate term fuck buddies our work tends to invite loads of tension and we all have different ways of working it off.&amp;nbsp; Ed&amp;#8217;s a soulless killing machine, Verrick don&amp;#8217;t care, Andrew prays and meditates, Anya and hecryn have seen it all before but Niran and Lily well the fuck every now and again.&amp;nbsp; Frankly as long as it doesn&amp;#8217;t interfere with our mission it&amp;#8217;s all well and good.&amp;nbsp; Lily describes Niran&amp;#8217;s mind as open inviting and intoxicating like a fly trap the strength of his emotions and sensory input can trap an unwary visitor in his mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EOD01&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lily has an outlook of concern when it comes to ED in action, it&amp;#8217;s not every day you see someone use a whole sky scraper as a melee weapon or chuck a mountain.&amp;nbsp; She has described Ed&amp;#8217;s mind as &amp;#8220;simple, focused on survival more than anything else but there are some odd bits starting to show up.&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andrew Clay&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like all of us Lily thinks the world of Andrew, it was him that managed to get those mutant girls to safe homes instead of letting them become sex slaves.&amp;nbsp; She is determined to see Andrew&amp;#8217;s vision of a finer world come to pass, a world where people like her won&amp;#8217;t be necessary.&amp;nbsp; Lily describes andrew&amp;#8217;s mind as an overwhelmingly bright light.&amp;nbsp; Like staring point blank into a quasar with a choral chant of infinite volume.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Verrick Bulat&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not every day one gets to work with someone with a kill count that would make Hiencrich Himmler jealous.&amp;nbsp; Verrick is a monster and Lily knows it, hell we all know it but he&amp;#8217;s indispensible to our stratagems so we tolerate him.&amp;nbsp; The actions of Verricks empire hit Lily closer than any of us since her old man actually fought Verricks armies back in the day.&amp;nbsp; Verrick for his part thinks of Lily as one more weapon to be utilized though his attitude is softening.&amp;nbsp; Verricks mind has been described as sinister beyond imagining a primordial darkness that invokes terrors long forgotten in the mind of any who visit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hecryn&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lily&amp;#8217;s drinking buddy and smoking partner, you&amp;#8217;d think they&amp;#8217;d be fucking on a regular basis but fucking seems to be the furthest thing from either of their minds when they get together.&amp;nbsp; They compare scars, missions, tactics, and more.&amp;nbsp; Lily taught Hecryn how to use guns, and Hecryn instructed Lily in swordplay and archery which is far more useful than one would think.&amp;nbsp; In spite of how he conducts himself on and off the battlefield lily describes hecryns mind as constantly weighing options and risks.&amp;nbsp; Almost like a calculator.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hector&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We get each other, plain and simple she was SAS I was Delta we both are cut from the same cloth.&amp;nbsp; Athena has some foolish idea that I have feelings for her but frankly its absurd.&amp;nbsp; Lily is an asset and team member and she sees me the same way.&amp;nbsp; We have a job to do, and a damn worthwhile one too, I can put my heart on hold to see this thing through and so can she.&amp;nbsp; She describes my mind as simple at first glance but with countless facets and paths beneath the surface.&amp;nbsp; She says it&amp;#8217;s fascinating to see it in action it&amp;#8217;s flattering I guess.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anya&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I had a shot for every time I heard &amp;#8220;Fuck&amp;#8217;s sake Anya get your sodding tits off the back of my head you knob&amp;#8221; it would likely overwhelm my synthetic parts and cause me to shut down.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Anya likes to play little &amp;#8220;pranks&amp;#8221; on Lily and considering the world&amp;#8217;s most dangerous predator going up against the world&amp;#8217;s most well trained soldier makes for some classic fucking theatre.&amp;nbsp; They have this weird little relationship where one minute they&amp;#8217;re bickering like kids and the next they&amp;#8217;re in lock step with each other.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#8217;ve got dozens of PHD&amp;#8217;s and doctorates, an augmented reality display that can make micro expressions as plain as day, and years of experience profiling folks, but damned if I can figure that shit out.&amp;nbsp; Lily says anya&amp;#8217;s mind is like a child at play, even when she&amp;#8217;s ripping someone in half.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Equipment&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily has a number of guns and other assorted weaponry at her disposal, she favors function over modern tech so she only uses a few modern firearms.&amp;nbsp; She has eschewed modern charge weaponry for more familiar ballistics by and large.&amp;nbsp; The most used items in her arsenal are listed below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Accuracy international A.W. 50&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A lovingly customized sniper rifle that pitches .50 BMG rounds at astonishing velocity, Lily has customized the rifle to convert it to a semi automatic configuration instead of the bolt action.&amp;nbsp; Enchantments in the chamber touches the propellant causing them to burn more completely and expand smoother resulting in a much higher muzzle velocity.&amp;nbsp; The sight is a british technomancy innovation known as a &amp;#8220;Willow wisp&amp;#8221; sight.&amp;nbsp; This nifty gadget can see living things through solid matter and instantly analyzes a person&amp;#8217;s vital organs.&amp;nbsp; The magazine has been expanded as well holding ten rounds instead of the normal five.&amp;nbsp; An ingenious system of structural braces further dampens the already minimal recoil and another system of enchantments eliminates noise and muzzle flare.&amp;nbsp; The final enchantment on the gun allows the bullets to phase through solid inorganic matter and slide right into the squishy person underneath or behind.&amp;nbsp; The bullet will only phase through an inch of solid matter, after that physics takes over.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SA80E&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A venerable model of British assault rifle the SA80E is being phased out in favor of newer models.&amp;nbsp; The SA80E is a jack of all trades assault rifle, but with lily&amp;#8217;s modifications it truly shines.&amp;nbsp; The foregrip and collapsible stock makes it very controllable in even the tightest of spaces further taking advantage of its bullpup design, and the reflex sight makes it ideally suited for close to mid range engagements.&amp;nbsp; Enchantments take hop up and recoil out of the gun and the expanded magazine allows for longer engagements.&amp;nbsp; The other enchantments and mechanical enhancements make the gun more rugged and robust able to take incredible abuse and punishment while operating perfectly.&amp;nbsp; She normally keeps a magazine on the rail and several combi magazines as well.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neosted 2000 c&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A compact magazine fed shotgun originating from South Africa lily has modified it extensively to pack even more of a punch than a normal shotgun.&amp;nbsp; This thing is not subtle every enchantment is centered around generating terrific muzzle velocity and impact force.&amp;nbsp; The enhanced force behind it requires someone with at least D rank strength to use one handed.&amp;nbsp; She has reinforced the weapon to withstand the force of the weapons recoil.&amp;nbsp; She keeps all manner of ammunition around for it as well, flechette, breaching, solid slug, rock salt, dragons breath, and so forth.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sig saur p226&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Wielded alone with an extended magazine this is essentially lily&amp;#8217;s last resort firearm.&amp;nbsp; Enchanted to eliminate noise and muzzle flash and reinforced to withstand being used as a bludgeon and endure all manner of environments these are essentially the old faithful of lilly&amp;#8217;s armory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compound bow&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It seems out of place for Lily to have a bow and arrow in her arsenal unless you consider the advantages a bow has, completely silent without magic or extra equipment, and retrievable ammo are still something firearms can&amp;#8217;t do.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore some things just laugh when they get tiny little holes punched in them.&amp;nbsp; Lily&amp;#8217;s bow has been modified to take advantage of her strength, the bow has a ten ton draw strength and is enchanted to bestow its arrows with a means to silence the sonic boom they cause when they fly as fast as they do.&amp;nbsp; The result of these arrows hitting someone is like watching princess mononoke.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GE M134 minigun&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; No subtlety here just good old American opposite of subtlety, enchanted to redirect heat into thermovoltaic cells the gun can fire ad nauseum as long as it has ammunition.&amp;nbsp; She has it belt fed and has a back pack unit that has been extensively modified to store ammunition extra dimensionally.&amp;nbsp; The backpack can hold ten thousand rounds at any given time before having to call upon more.&amp;nbsp; The rest of the ammunition is stored extra dimensionally and reloading the entire backpack unit takes thirty miniutes between full firing cycles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Type 6 Rifle Resistant armor&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Commissioned from the European Federtion&amp;#8217;s Lux Omnia Vinci initiative as a reward for helping secure some rather elusive assets this rifle resistant armor doesn&amp;#8217;t stop bullets at all.&amp;nbsp; Using light manipulation technology the armor essentially baffles the perception of any around this has two benefits.&amp;nbsp; One it bestows a sort of psychic invisibility meaning everyone simply looks past or ignores her when she wears it.&amp;nbsp; Two when found the armor lets loose a sort of chaff that works on multiple modes of perception.&amp;nbsp; Sight, smell, hearing, even more exotic forms of detection are baffled subtly making would be gunmen or assailants miss by mere inches.&amp;nbsp; As anything more would immediately put an experienced shooter on guard and lead them to adjust their aim the wearer must still intelligently utilize cover to maximize the armor system&amp;#8217;s effectiveness.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Khonshu Tactical Hood&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A tactical hood that scrambles any facial recognition, thermal or x ray cam, or scrying and psychomancy attempts.&amp;nbsp; It also warps the wearer&amp;#8217;s voice into something exceedingly menacing, projecting dominance and making even the most resolute gunmen lose their focus and their nerve.&amp;nbsp; The mask also lets the wearer see as if he or she is in a well lit room and can eliminate the obscuring affects of gas or fog.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mountain man Camel back&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Capable of holding ten liters of water in an extra dimensional space taking a good deal of weight off of the soldier, it is enchanted to keep the liquid cold.&amp;nbsp; Nine times out of ten instead of water the camelback holds a sort of witch&amp;#8217;s brew made by Commonwealth Apothecaries.&amp;nbsp; A liter can keep a soldier fed and hydrated for a whole day, special forces operators get a more potent variation of the brew called a soldier&amp;#8217;s draught that gives them the benefit with just a sip.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Variations exist for different climates and aid a soldier immensely in survival situations.&amp;nbsp; In addition the brew can be poured on the skin to serve as a salve and disinfectant, and can purify rotten food.&amp;nbsp; It won&amp;#8217;t close a bullet hole but it&amp;#8217;ll make it a hell of a lot more bearable.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lily belongs to &lt;a target=&quot;_self&quot; href=&quot;http://gurlow.deviantart.com/&quot;
